<h2>Foreword</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 50px;">
<img src="images/deco-foreword.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The Truly Clever know enough to
make books of a country by a few
days of Pullman and hotel—or even
by skimming the public library at home,
without the bother and expense of travel
at all.</p>

<p>But the few Dullards now left can arrive
in Knowledge only by plodding; not “as
on wings of eagles” and Inspiration, but by
the drudgery of learning.</p>

<p>It has taken more than twenty-five arduous
years to beat into me what little I hope
I know about the Frontiers of the Three
Americas. To learn several new languages
and digest innumerable old chronicles was
but one side of the task: everywhere, and
among many peoples, I had to win slow
adoption from Stranger to Friend; to travel
footsore or saddleweary; to share their
beds, their feasts, their famine, their
speech, their ideas, their pleasures and
their hardships—in fact, to live their life.
And it <em>was</em> Life—Human and warm, even
at its rudest.</p>

<p>Part of these stories, under this same
title, were published in 1897 by an amateur
firm which very presently succumbed—<i lang="la">post
hoc</i>, indeed, but I trust not <i lang="la">propter</i>. So
the book has been out of print for a dozen
years. It was very gently entreated by
critics and public while its young godfathers
lasted.</p>

<p>I now add five stories and 4,000 miles of
geography—clear back to my venerable
boyhood. Born and bred a Yankee, I
Escaped In Time (at 23), and have become
a much better Indian, New Mexican, Mexican,
Peruvian, Californian and composite
<i lang="es">Paisano</i> of the Frontier. It may be that
other graduate New Englanders will find
here some echo to memory of what they
and I used to think we knew of the Stern
and Rockbound, so long ago; and that the
Unremoved will pardon my lapses, in view
of my enduring Alibi.</p>

<p>As to anything this side of New England,
I won’t “either apologize or fight.” This
part is not remote and precarious memory
of the only true Golden Age—the Age when
we Haven’t Any—but the indelible autograph
of thirty older years, scarred and
wrinkled upon me inside and out. It can
take care of itself.</p>

<p>Most of these stories, in both instances,
are of episodes in which I had some part.
Not all are “True Stories,” but all are
truthful. I hope that makes them no duller
than if they had been guessed out of whole
cloth and innocence.</p>

<p>Lelo dropped the point of his heavy irrigating
hoe and stood with chin dented
upon the rude handle, looking intently to the
east. Around his bare ankles the rill from
the <i lang="es">acéquia</i><a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> eddied a moment and then
sucked through the gap in the little ridge of
earth which bounded the irrigating bed.
The early sun was yellow as gold upon the
crags of the <i lang="es">mesa</i><a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>—that league-long front
of ragged cliffs whose sandstones, black-capped
by the lava of the immemorial Year
of Fire, here wall the valley of the Rio
Grande on the west. Where a spur of the
frowning Kú-mai runs out is a little bay in
the cliffs; and here the outermost fields of
Isleta were turning green with spring. The
young wheat swayed and whispered to the
water, whose scouts stole about amid the
stalks, and came back and called their fellows
forward, and spread hither and yon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
till every green blade was drinking and the
tide began to creep up the low boundaries
at either side. Up at the sluice gate a small
but eager stream was tumbling from the
big, placid ditch, and on it came till it struck
the tiny dam which closed the furrow just
beyond Lelo, and, turning, stole past him
again to join the rest amid the wheat. The
irrigating bed, twenty feet square, filled
and filled, and suddenly the gathered puddle
broke down a barrier and came romping
into the next bed without so much as
saying “By your leave.” And here it was
not so friendly; for, forgetting that it had
come only to bring a drink, it went stampeding
about, knocking down the tender
blades and half covering them with mud.
At sound of this, Lelo seemed suddenly to
waken, and lifting with his hoe the few clods
which dammed the furrow, he dropped
them into the first gap, and jumping into
the second bed repaired its barrier also
with a few strokes. Then he let in a gentler
stream from the furrow.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Poco</i>, and I should have lost a bed,” he
said to himself, goodnaturedly. Blas always
took things easy, and I presume that is the
reason no one ever called him anything but
Lelo<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>—“Slow-poke”—for Indian boys are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
as given to nicknames as are any others, and
the <i lang="es">mote</i> had stuck to him ever since its invention.
He <em>was</em> rather slow—this big,
powerful boy, with a round, heavy chin and
a face less clear-cut than was common in
the pueblo. Old ’Lipe had taken to wife a
Navajo captive, and all could see that the
boy carried upon his father’s strong frame
the flatter, more stolid features of his
mother’s nomad people.</p>

<p>But now the face seemed not quite so
heavy; for again he was looking toward the
pueblo and bending his head as one who
listens for a far whisper. There it came
again—a faint, faint air which not one of
us could have heard, but to this Indian boy
it told of shouts and mingled wails.</p>

<p>“What will be?” cried Lelo, stamping
his hoe upon the barrier, and with unwonted
fire in his eyes. “For surely I hear the
voice of women lamenting, and there are
men’s shouts as in anger. Something heavy
it will be—and perhaps I am needed.”
Splashing up to the ditch, he shut the gate
and threw down his hoe, and a moment
later was running toward Isleta with the
long, heavy, tireless stride that was the
jest of the other boys in the rabbit hunt,
but left Lelo not so very far behind them
after all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>In the pueblo was, indeed, excitement
enough. Little knots of the swart people
stood here and there, talking earnestly but
low; in the broad, flat plaza were many hurrying
to and fro; and in the street beyond
was a great crowd about a house whence
arose the long, wild wails of mourners.</p>

<p>“What is, <i lang="es">tio</i> Diego?” asked Lelo, stopping
where a number of men stood in
gloomy silence. “What has befallen? For
even in the <i lang="es">milpa</i><a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> I heard the cries, and
came running to see.”</p>

<p>“It is ill,” answered the old man he had
addressed as uncle. “It seems that Those
Above are angry with us! For this morning
the captain of war finds himself dead in
bed—and <em>scalped</em>! And no tracks of man
were about his door.”</p>

<p>“Ay, <em>all</em> is ill!” groaned a short, heavy-set
man, in a frayed blanket. “For yesterday,
coming from the <i lang="es">llano</i><a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> with my burro,<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
I met a stranger—a <i lang="es">bárbaro</i>. And, blowing
upon Paloma, he bewitched the poor
beast so that it sprang off the trail and was
killed at the bottom of the cliff. It lacked
only that! Last month it was the raid of
the Cumanche; and, though we followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
and slew many of the robbers and got back
many animals, yet mine were not found,
and this was the very last that remained
to me.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Pero</i>, Don ’Colás!” cried Lelo, “your
burro I saw this very morning as I went to
the field before the sun. Paloma it was,
with the white face and the white hind foot—for
do I not know him well? He was
passing through the bushes under the cliffs
at the point, and turned to look at me as I
crossed the fields below.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Vaya!</i>” cried Nicolás, angrily. “Did
I not see him, with these my eyes, jump the
cliff of two hundred feet yesterday, and
with these my hands feel him at the foot
that he was dead? Go, with your stories of
a stupid, for——”</p>

<p>But here the alguazil, who was one of the
group, interrupted: “Lelo has no fool’s
eyes, and this thing I shall look into. Since
this morning, many things look suspicious.
Come, show me where fell thy burro—for
to me all these doings are cousins one to
another.”</p>

<p>Nicolás, with angry confidence, accompanied
the broad-shouldered Indian sheriff,
and their companions followed silently.
Across the adobe-walled gardens they
trudged, and into the sandy “draw,” whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
trail led along the cliff and up among the
jumble of fallen crags at one side.</p>

<p>“Yonder he jumped off,” said ’Colás,
“and fell——” But even then he rubbed
his eyes and turned pale. For where he
had left the limp, bleeding carcass of poor
Paloma only twenty-four hours before,
there was now nothing to be seen. Only,
upon a rock, were a few red blotches.</p>

<p>“What is this!” demanded the alguazil,
sternly. “Hast thou hidden him away?
<i lang="es">Claro</i> that something fell here—for there is
blood and a tuft of hair upon yon stone.
But where is the burro?”</p>

<p>“How should I hide him, since he was
dead as the rocks? It is witchcraft, I tell
you—for see! There are no tracks of him
going away, even where the earth is soft.
And for the coyotes and wildcats—they
would have left his bones. The Gentile I
met—<em>he</em> is the witch. First he gave the
evil eye to my poor beast, that it killed itself;
and now he has flown away in its shape
to do other ills.”</p>

<p>“It can be so,” mused the sheriff, gravely;
“but in the meantime there is no remedy—I
have to answer to the Fathers of Medicine
for you who bring such stories of dead
burros, but cannot show them. For, I tell
you, this has something to say for the deed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
that was done in the pueblo this morning.
<i lang="es">Al calaboz!</i>”</p>

<p>Half an hour later, poor Nicolás was
squatted disconsolately upon the bare floor
of the adobe jail—that simple prison from
which no one of the simple prisoners ever
thinks to dig out. It is not so much the
clay wall that holds them, as the authority
of law, which no Pueblo ever yet questioned.</p>

<p>“’Colás’s burro” was soon in every
mouth. The strange story of its death
and its reappearance to Lelo were not to be
mocked at. So it used to be, that the animals
were as people; and every one knew
that there were witches still who took the
forms of brutes and flew by night to work
mischief. Perhaps it was some wizard of
the Cumanche who thus, by the aid of the
evil ones, was avenging the long-haired
horse-thieves who had fallen at Tajique.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
And now Pascual, returning from a ranch
across the river, made known that, sitting
upon his roof all night to think of the year,
he had been aware of a burro that passed
down the street even to the house of the
war captain; after which he had noticed it
no more. Clearly, then!</p>

<p>Some even thought that Lelo should be
imprisoned, since he had seen the burro in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the morning. And when, searching anew,
they found in a splinter of the captain’s
door a long, coarse, gray hair, every man
looked about him suspiciously. But there
was no other clew—save that Francisco,
the cleverest of hunters, called the officials
to a little corner of the street, where the
people had not crowded, and pointed to
some dim marks in the sand.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Que importa?</i>” said the gray haired
governor, shrugging his shoulders, as he
leaned on his staff of office and looked closely.
“In Isleta there are two thousand burros,
and their paths are everywhere.”</p>

<p>“But see!” persisted the trailer. “Are
they like this? For this brute was lame in
all the legs, so that his feet fell over to the
inside a little, instead of coming flatly down.
It will be the Enchanted Burro!”</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Ahu!</i>” cried Lelo, who stood by. “And
this morning when I passed the burro of
Don ’Colás in the bushes, I saw that it was
laming along as if its legs were stiff.”</p>

<p>By now no one doubted that there was
witchcraft afoot, and the officials whose place
it is were taking active measures to preserve
the pueblo. The cacique sat in his
closed house fasting and praying, with
ashes upon his head. The Cum-pa-huit-la-wen
were running here and there with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
sacred bows and arrows, prying into every
corner, if haply they might find a witch. In
the house of mourning the Shamans were
blinding the eyes of the ghosts, that none
might follow the trail of the dead captain
and do him harm before he should reach
the safe other world. And in the medicine
house the Father of All Medicine was blowing
the slow smoke across the sacred bowl,
to read in that magic mirror the secrets of
the whole world.</p>

<p>But in spite of everything, a curse seemed
to have fallen upon the peaceful town. Lucero,
the third assistant war captain, did
not return with his flock, and when searchers
went to the <i lang="es">llano</i>, they found him lying
by a chapparo bush dead, and his sheep
gone. But worst of all, he was scalped, and
all the wisdom of that cunning head had
been carried away to enrich the mysterious
foe—for the soul and talents of an Indian
go with his hair, according to Indian belief.
And in a day or two came running Antonio
Peralta to the pueblo, gray as the dead and
without his blanket. Herding his father’s
horses back of the Accursed Hill, he sat
upon a block of lava to watch them. As
they grazed, a lame burro came around the
hill grazing toward them. And when it was
among them, they suddenly raised their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
heads in fear and snorted and turned to
run; but the burro, rising like a mountain
lion, sprang upon one of them and fastened
on its neck, and all the herd stampeded to
the west, the accursed burro still perched
upon its victim and tearing it. Ay! a gray
burro, <i lang="es">jovero</i>,<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and with a white foot behind.
Antonio had his musket, but he dared not
fire after this witch beast. And here were
twelve more good horses gone of what the
Cumanche robbers had left.</p>

<p>By now the whole pueblo was wrought to
the highest tension. That frightful doubt
which seizes a people oppressed by supernatural
fears brooded everywhere. No man
but was sure that the man he hated was
mixed up in the witchcraft; no man who
was disliked by any one but felt the finger
of suspicion pointing at him. People grew
dumb and moody, and looked at each other
from the corner of the eye as they passed
without even a kindly “<i>Hina-kú-p’wiu</i>,
neighbor.” As for work, that was almost
forgotten, though the fields cried out for
care. No one dared take a flock to the <i lang="es">llano</i>,
and few went even to their gardens. There
were medicine makings every night to exorcise
the evil spirits, and the Shamans
worked wonders, and the medicine guards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
prowled high and low for witches. The
cacique sat always in his house, seeing no
one, nor eating, but torturing his flesh for
the safety of his people.</p>

<p>And still there was no salvation. Not a
night went by but some new outrage befell.
Now it was a swooping away of herds,
now some man of the wisest and bravest
was slain and scalped in his bed. And always
there were no more tracks than those
of a burro, stiff-kneed, whose hoofs did not
strike squarely upon the ground. Many,
also, caught glimpses of the Enchanted
Burro as they peered at midnight from
their dark windows. Sometimes he plodded
mournfully along the uncertain streets, as
burros do; but some vowed that he came
down suddenly from the sky, as alighting
from a long flight. Without a doubt, old
Melo had seen the brute walk up the ladder
of Ambrósio’s house the very night Ambrósio
was found dead in the little lookout
room upon his own roof. And a burro
which could climb a ladder could certainly
fly.</p>

<p>On the fourth day Lelo could stand it no
longer. “I am going to the field,” he said,
“before the wheat dies. For it is as well
to be eaten by the witches now as that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
should starve to death next winter, when
there will be nothing to eat.”</p>

<p>“What folly is this?” cried the neighbors.
“Does Lelo think he is stronger than
the ghosts? Let him stay behind those
who are more men.”</p>

<p>But Lelo had another trait, quite as
marked as his slowness and good nature.
When his deliberate mind was made up
there was no turning him; and, though he
was as terrified as anyone by the awful
happenings of the week, he had decided to
attend to his field. So he only answered
the taunts with a stolid, respectful: “No, I
do not put myself against the ghosts. But
perhaps they will let me alone, knowing
that my mother has now no one else to feed
her.”</p>

<p>The flat-faced mother brought him two
<i lang="es">tortillas</i><a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> for lunch; and putting her hands
upon his shoulders, looked at him a moment
from wet eyes, saying not a word. And
slinging over his shoulder the bow-case and
quiver, Lelo trudged away.</p>

<p>He plodded along the crooked meadow
road, white-patched here and there with
crystals of alkali; jumped the main irrigating
ditch with a great bound, and took
“across lots” over the adobe fences and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
through the vineyards and the orchards of
apple, peach and apricot.</p>

<p>In the farther edge of the last orchard
stood a tiny adobe house, where old Reyes
had lived in the summer-time to guard her
ripening fruits. Since her death it had been
abandoned, with the garden, and next summer
the Indian congress could allot it to
any one who asked, since it would have
been left untilled for five years. The
house was half hidden from sight—overshadowed
on one side by ancient pear trees
and on the other by the black cliffs of an
advance guard of the lava flow.</p>

<p>As he passed the ruined hut Lelo suddenly
stooped and began looking anxiously
at a footprint in the soft earth. “That was
from no moccasin of the Tee-wahn,” he
muttered to himself, “for the sole is flatter
than ours. And it comes out of the house,
where no one ever goes, now that Grandmother
Reyes is dead. But <em>this</em>! For in
three steps it is no more the foot of a man,
but of a beast—going even to the bushes
where I saw the Enchanted Burro that
morning”—and all of a tremble, Lelo
leaned up against the wall of the house. It
was all he could do to keep from turning
and bolting for home—and you need not
laugh at him. The bow-case at his side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
was from the tawny mountain lion Lelo had
slain with his own hands in the cañons of
the Tetilla; and when Refúgio, the youngest
medicine-man, fell wounded in the fore-front
of the fight at Tajique, it was Lelo
who had lumbered forward and brought
him away in his arms, saving his life and
hair from the Cumanche knife. But it takes
a braver man to stand against his own
superstitions than to face wild beast or
wilder savage; and now, though Lelo did
not flee, his knees smote together and the
blood seemed to have left his head dry and
over-light. He sat down, so weak was he;
and, with back against the wall, he tried to
gather his scattered thoughts.</p>

<p>At that very moment, if Lelo had turned
his head a very little more to the left and
looked at one particular rift in the thorny
greasewoods that choked the foot of the
cliff, he might have seen two dark, hungry
eyes fixed upon him; but Lelo was not looking
that way so much as to the corner of
the cliff. There he would have to pass to
the field; and it was just around that corner
that he had seen the Enchanted Burro.
“And there also I have seen the mouth of a
cave, where they say the ogres used to
live and where no one dares to enter”—and
he shivered again, like one half frozen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Then he did look back to the left, but saw
nothing, for the eyes were no longer there.
Only, a few rods farther to the left, and
where Lelo could not see for the wall at his
back, the tall, white ears of a burro were
moving quietly along in the bushes, which
hid the rest of its body. Now and then the
animal stopped and cocked up its ears, as if
to listen; and its eyes rose over the bush,
shining with a deep, strange light. Just
beyond was the low adobe wall which separated
Reyes’s garden from the next—running
from the foot of the cliff down past the
old house.</p>

<p>To go on to the field needed even more
courage than to keep from fleeing for home;
and stubborn as he was, Lelo was trying to
muster up legs and heart to proceed. He
even rose to his feet and drew back his
elbows fiercely, straining the muscles of his
chest, where there seemed to be such a
weight. Just around the corner of the
house, at that same moment, a burro’s
head, with white ears and a blazed face,
rose noiselessly above the adobe fence, and
seeing nothing, a pair of black hoofs came
up, and in a swift bound the animal was
over the wall—so lightly that even the
sharp Indian ears not fifteen feet away
heard nothing of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>But if Lelo did not notice, a sharper
watcher did. “<i>Kay-eé-w’yoo!</i>” cried a
complaining voice, and a brown bird with
broad wings and a big, round head went
fluttering from its perch on the roof. Lelo
started violently, and then smiled at himself.
“It is only <i lang="es">tecolóte</i>,” he muttered,
“the little owl that lives with the <i lang="es">túsas</i>,<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
and they say he is very wise. To see
where he went.”</p>

<p>The boy stole around the corner of the
house, but the owl was nowhere to be seen,
and he started back.</p>

<p>As he turned the angle again, he caught
sight of a burro’s head just peeping from
around the other corner; and Lelo felt the
blood sinking from his face. The beast
gave a little start and then dropped its
head to a bunch of alfalfa that was green at
the corner. But this did not relieve Lelo’s
terror. It was Paloma—dead Paloma—now
the Witch Burro. There was no mistaking
that <i lang="es">jovero</i> face. And plain it was,
too, that this was no longer burro-true, but
one of the accursed spirits in burro shape.
Those eyes! They seemed, in that swift
flash in which they had met Lelo’s, to be
sunk far, far into the skull; and he was
sure that deep in them he saw a dull gleam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
of red. And the ears and head—they were
touched with death, too! Their skin seemed
hard and ridgy as a rawhide, instead of fitting
as the skin does in life. So, also, was
the neck; but no more was to be seen for
the angle of the wall.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;" id="illus2">
<img src="images/illus2.jpg" width="450" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption">LELO</p>
</div>

<p>There are men who die at seventy without
having lived so long or suffered so much
as Lelo lived and suffered in those few seconds.
His breath refused to come, and his
muscles seemed paralyzed. This, then,
was the Enchanted Burro—the witch that
had slain the captain of war, and his lieutenants,
and many more. And now he was
come for Lelo—for though he nosed the
alfalfa, one grim eye was always on the
boy. So, no doubt, he had watched his
other victims—but from <em>behind</em>, for not
one of them had ever moved. And with
that thought a sudden rush of blood came
pricking like needles in Lelo’s head.</p>

<p>“No one of them saw him, else they had
surely fought! And shall I give myself to
him like a sheep? Not if he were <em>ten</em>
witches!” And with the one swift motion
of all his life, the lad dropped on one knee,
even as hand and hand clapped notch to
bowstring, and, in a mighty tug, drew the
arrow to the head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Lightning-like as was his move, the burro
understood, and hastily reared back—but
a hair too late. The agate-tipped shaft
struck midway of its neck with a loud tap
as upon a drum, and bored through and
through till the feathers touched the skin.
The animal sprang high in air, with so
wild and hideous a scream as never came
from burro’s throat before, and fell back
amid the alfalfa, floundering and pawing at
its neck.</p>

<p>But Lelo had waited for no more. Already
he was over the wall and running like
a scared mustang, the bow gripped in his
left hand, his right clutching the bow-case,
whose tawny tail leaped and fluttered behind
him. One-Eyed Quico could have
made it to the pueblo no faster than the
town slow-poke, who burst into the plaza
and the porch of the governor’s house,
gasping:</p>

<p>“The Enchanted Burro! I have—killed—him!”</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later the new war captain,
the medicine men, the governor, and
half the rest of the men of the pueblo were
entering Reyes’s garden, and Lelo was allowed
to walk with the <i lang="es">principales</i>. All were
very grave, and some a little pale—for it
was no laughing matter to meddle with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
fiend, even after he was dead. There lay
the burro, motionless. No pool of blood was
around; but the white feathers of the arrow
had turned red. Cautiously they approached
till suddenly Francisco, the sharpest
eyed of trailers, dashed forward and
caught up the two hind legs from amid the
alfalfa, crying:</p>

<p>“Said I not that he tipped the hoofs?
With reason!”</p>

<p>For from each ankle five dark, naked toes
projected through a slit in the hide.</p>

<p>“Ay, well bewitched!” exclaimed the
war captain. “Pull me the other side!”
And at their tug the belly of the burro
parted lengthwise, showing only a stiff,
dried skin, and inside the cavity a swart
body stripped to the breech-clout. Alongside
lay arrows and a strong bow of buffalo
horn, with a light copper hatchet and a keen
scalping knife.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Sácalo!</i>” ordered the war captain; but
it was easier said than done. They bent
the stubborn rawhide well apart; but not
until one had run his knife up the neck of
the skin and cut both ends of Lelo’s arrow
could they haul out the masquerader. The
shaft had passed through his throat from
side to side, pinning it to the rawhide, and
there he had died.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>When the slippery form was at last
dragged forth, and they saw its face, there
was a startled murmur through the crowd;
for even without the long scalp lock and the
vermilion face-paint, there were many there
who would have known the Cumanche medicine
man, whose brother was the chief that
fell at Tajique. He, too, had been taken
prisoner, and had taunted his captors and
promised to pay them, and in the night had
escaped, leaving one sentinel dead and another
wounded.</p>

<p>The Enchanted Burro was all very plain
now. The plains conjurer, knowing well
by habit how to play on superstitious fears,
had used poor Paloma as the instrument of
his revenge—hiding the carcass and drying
the skin quickly on a frame with hot
ashes, so that it stood perfectly in shape by
itself. The bones of the fore legs he had
left in, to be managed with his hands; and
in the dark or amid grass, no one would
have noticed the peculiarity of the hind
legs. He had only to pry open the slit in
the belly and crawl in, and the stiff hide
closed after him. Thus he had wreaked the
vengeance for which, uncompanioned, he
had followed the Pueblos back to their village.
In the cave behind the greasewoods
were the scalps of his victims, drying on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
little willow hoops; but instead of going to
deck a Cumanche lodge in the great plains,
they were tenderly buried in the old church-yard,
restored to their proper owners.</p>

<p>After all these years there still are in the
pueblo many tales of the Enchanted Burro,
nothing lost by the re-telling. As for the
skin itself, it lies moth-eaten in the dark
storeroom of the man who has been first
assistant war captain for twenty years,
beginning his novitiate the very day he
finished a witch and a Cumanche with a
single arrow.</p>

<h3>The Mummy Miner.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 50px;">
<img src="images/deco-chap.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="" />
</div>

<p>There was certainly nothing suggestive
of antiquity about Faquito’s appearance.
His droll, brown face, his thickset
boyish figure and the alarming tatters
of his scant apparel were all undignified as
his name—which had got to the most disrespectful
distance possible from the stately
Francisco of the baptismal font. There
could be no worthier name for a boy of
Peru than that worn by the great <i lang="es">conquistador</i>
Pizarro. But it is hard to live up to the
dignity of the christening, and Francisco
degenerates into Francisquito, which is
fond; and then to Franco, which is familiar;
and finally to Faquito, which is positively
rude. Probably it never occurred to the
lad to be comforted with thinking that the
greatest conqueror of the Americas was
called Faquito, too, when he was herding
his pigs in Truxillo; and that if one Faquo
could grow up to be Don Francisco, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
might another. These consolations of philosophy
never do come to us until we are too
old to need them so much.</p>

<p>But perhaps you are thinking: “Well,
why <em>should</em> a twelve-year-old <i lang="es">cholo</i> boy look
antiquated? Are lads of that age in Peru
expected to be ancient, any more than in
New York or Boston?”</p>

<p>N-no, not exactly that—though in the
quick tropics a boy <em>is</em> older at twelve than
is one of the same years in the temperate
zone; bigger and more mature. But it was
Faquito’s occupation rather than his age
which made me think of him as rather paradoxical.
You will admit that to find this
irresponsible, twinkling face set in one of
the most century-worn frames on earth
might well seem incongruous, not to say
startling. The sight of this half Spanish,
half Indian<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> boy of to-day, playing with
lives and thoughts that were forgotten five
hundred years ago—aye, and some of them,
perhaps, that long before the Old World
dreamed there was a New—was enough
to make any explorer rub his eyes.</p>

<p>Doubtless we shall understand each other
better by a little translation. <i lang="es">Huaco</i> is a
word not found in the Spanish dictionaries,
for it belongs only to Peru. It is from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Quichua, or speech of the Incas, of whom
you have heard so many remarkable (and
not very accurate) stories; and as adopted
into the Spanish of Peru means specifically
a relic of the ancient Indian “civilizations”
which occupied this strange land before the
coming of Europeans. <i lang="es">Huaquero</i> is the
Spanish derivative to mean a digger of
these antiquities—in other words, a <em>mummy
miner</em>. This is a regular profession in
Peru, just as much as gold mining. A
competent huaquero commands as good
wages as a skilled laborer in the marvelous
silver mountain of Cerro de Pasco; and, if
he works “on his own hook,” <em>may</em> earn
much more. Peru is dotted everywhere
with the ruins of large towns of the Incas
and other tribes—some of them that we
have so long been taught to regard as
“kings” and the like, while in fact they
were tribes very much like the Pueblo
Indians of New Mexico; remarkably advanced
in some things, but still entirely
Indians socially, politically and mentally.
Some of these ruins have been deserted for
uncounted centuries, and no man can say
who built them nor when they were abandoned.
In fact, Peru is the American
Egypt in antiquity; and a more than Egypt
in richness. It was in its time the richest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
country in the world. Even before Europeans
came to tap its peaks of silver and
valleys of gold, the ancient Peruvians had
discovered a way to treat the precious
metals, and used them to adorn themselves
and their temples. Like the Indians they
were, they had the invariable Indian idea of
the next world; and always buried with their
dead the best clothing and other property, to
give the wanderer a handsome start beyond
the grave—precisely as our aborigines do
still. And as the dryness of the Peruvian
desert preserves mummies indefinitely
through the ages, you will begin to see how
mummy mining has become one of the important
industries of Peru. There are
mummies everywhere; and each mummy
has still what was its wealth in life. The
gold and silver trinkets, the exquisite cloths
and potteries of these strange folk of old,
and all the other relics of their handiwork,
fetch high prices from museums and collectors.</p>

<p>So that was Faquo’s business—and a very
hard and unpleasant business it is. <i lang="es">Taita</i><a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
Pedro should have provided for his family;
but <i lang="es">taita</i> Pedro much preferred to lie
around the great sugar plantation in the
next valley beyond the arm of desert, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
keep his swarthy hide full of the cheap rum
which is the last and worst gift of the sugar
cane. He never came home to the little
cabin at Lurin—a hut of <i lang="es">quincha</i>, or wattled
bamboos plastered with adobe—except
to get money. Poor, fat Maria would have
had a very rough time caring for her fat
brood, if it had not been for Faquito. She
worked in the cane fields of the nearer hacienda,
and washed for the priest; but the
few <i lang="es">reales</i> she could earn would not have
been enough to put a cotton shirt on half
the backs she was responsible for, after
feeding all the mouths. Mariquita was a
perfect little woman for ten years old; but
she could only attend to the babies—which
was indeed contract enough for a much
older nurse. So it had been a great relief
when Faquo got big enough to be a producer—with
the equal good fortune that
the sandy headland only two miles away
was crowned by the mighty ruins of Pachacámac.</p>

<p>Every day, except Sundays and <i lang="es">fiestas</i>,
Faquito was early trudging the dusty road
to the ruins, his spade over his shoulder,
his fat face screwed up sometimes to whistle
a doleful yaraví (the only air he knew), or
as often equally twisted with munching
sugar cane. It was very convenient to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
have one’s candy growing by the roadside—particularly
as there were no stores. All
a boy had to do was to clamber over the
adobe wall, cut a stalk of the <i lang="es">caña dulce</i>
from amid its dense bristle of sword leaves,
and clamber back to chew upon this pithy
molasses candy at leisure. There was
generally a culm in Faquito’s hand as he
trudged across; and when he got tired of
chewing the obstinate fiber, he would rest
his jaws with whistling.</p>

<p>When he had crossed the flat, and waded
the shallow brook of Lurin, there was a
great scramble up the precipitous bluff
which is the jumping-off place of the desert;
and even Faquo was always puffing hard by
the time he came to the top. An ancient
wall was there; and under the long, morning
shadow of this he used to sit down a
moment—partly for a bit of a rest, and
partly because he liked to gaze upon that
strange vista in the hot, level light. Behind
was the lovely valley, dense green with
tropic cane-fields and bananas and palms;
but in front was the great, gray desert, unspotted
by one living blade. On the rolling
sand hills close before him was a wild, mysterious
huddle of mighty walls, tall and
broken and gray in the sunlight, with black
shadows lurking in their angles—walls and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
walls in a bewildering labyrinth. At his
left was the huge castle on its tall headland,
boxed about with tier after tier of
walls thirty feet high; and in front of him
the central hill, crowned with an enormous
building. In a hollow at the foot of the
castle, fifty acres were thick-dotted with
dark, irregular holes, around which thousands
of white specks gleamed in the sun.
Momently, too, little puffs of dust flew up
here and there. Castro and Juan and Pancho,
the grown-up huaqueros from Lima,
were already at work down there amid the
bleaching skulls, each at the bottom of his
dusty shaft, hoping at any moment to find a
rich tomb—perhaps even the “Big Fish”
of Peruvian folk lore. That is what Faquito
was dreaming about, too. How many times
he had heard of the hundreds of man-loads
of gold that the Yuncas buried in Pachacámac
when Hernando Pizarro came pricking
down from the mountains, every horse
of his cavalcade shod with silver!</p>

<p>If he could only find the <i lang="es">Pez Grande</i>! Or
even the tail of it! He got up from under
the wall with a sigh and started down the
dusty trail toward where the men were at
work. His “mine” was there too—where
he had dug a week without finding any but
the poorest graves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Just then an owl—the little brown owl of
the desert—flew up almost at his very feet
and alighted upon a wall a few rods away.
How Mariquita would like it for a pet!
Faquo crept up behind the wall; but just
as he was about to clap his hat over the bird
it fluttered off a few rods farther.</p>

<p>It was so stupid with the sun that Faquo
felt sure he would get it this time, and
again he crept up. But stupid as the owl
was, it was just too smart for Faquo. A
dozen times it was almost in his hands; but
a dozen times, too, it fluttered away again—until
it had led him up the central hill,
through the great ruined building there, and
down the other side.</p>

<p>At the foot of an adobe wall sixty feet high
it settled upon the edge of some deep-sunken
rooms. Faquo scrambled down a
gap and stole out along the parapet; and
suddenly reaching up from this shelter
caught the astonished bird by the wing.
But he had forgotten the beak and claws,
which the very field-mice know. As they
hooked savagely into his brown fist he drew
back sharply—and just too far. The ledge
was very narrow; and overbalanced by his
recoil, he fell sprawling twenty feet into the
great cell below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Luckily there was at the bottom nothing
harder than the universal in-blown sand;
and though sadly shaken up by the fall
Faquo was not seriously hurt. For a few
moments he lay there half stunned; then
slowly gathered himself up and looked
about in a dazed way.</p>

<p>The owl was still in his hand—less by his
grasp than by the obstinate clenching of
its own curved claws, which now began to
hurt again. He unhooked them painfully,
one by one, tore a tatter from his shirt and
tied it about those mischievous feet. A
rather stubborn boy, Faquo. It was very
hard to turn his attention from anything
upon which he had once started, until it was
finished.</p>

<p>At last, when his prize was safely
anchored to a clod of adobe, he was free to
think of more important matters. <i lang="es">Pues!</i>
He had walked into a bad trap. There
were no doors nor windows down here—clearly
the ancients had descended into
these cellar-like rooms by ladders, which
had long ago disappeared. And how was he
to get up that twenty feet? In this adobe
he could cut steps to the top; or even, in
time, burrow through the base of that
eight-foot wall—but his spade stood away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
up there on the ledge, leaning against the
parapet where he had left it.</p>

<p>“Castro! Cas-tro-o!” he screamed at the
top of his lungs—but it seemed that his
voice did not rise at all out of the sunken
chamber. How buried and pent it was!
He shouted until he was hoarse; but knew
as well that the huaqueros did not hear him,
as if he could have seen them still digging
stolidly away, far down the other side of
the hill.</p>

<p>The place grew terrible to him. In such
a maze of ruins they might not find him
until too late. Maria would come to look,
surely, if he were not home by dark; but
how could she expect to find him so far from
where he always worked?</p>

<p>He knew well, this boy of the edge of the
desert, that one does not last long on such
a gridiron of the tropics. Without food one
may do for several days; but without water,
under that sun——! Already his mouth
was parched.</p>

<p>And that <i lang="es">maldito</i> owl—that was to blame
for it all! He started up angrily with a
clod of adobe to throw at it. But his arm
dropped suddenly. “No! <i lang="es">Nana</i> says always
that the birds, too, are children of
<i lang="es">Taita Diós</i>, and that He loves best those
who are good to them. So perhaps I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
punished for catching it. <i lang="es">Pobrecito!</i> For
now we both are caught.”</p>

<p>The owl did not seem to mind so much.
It sat bunched upon its tethered feet, blinking
back at Faquo. It looked so very grave,
so very wise! <i lang="es">Quiza</i> it knew very much
about the ruins; for here it had lived, and
its people, very long now. Perhaps it even
knew where was the Big Fish!</p>

<p>Even as Faquo looked at it with these
thoughts, the owl turned its head down on
one side, and looked at him soberly along
its shoulder. Some might have laughed at
this proceeding, but not so Faquito. He
was too good an Indian to despise the wisdom
of them that talk not; and suddenly
he asked with great earnestness: “In truth
that thou dost know, friend owl! No?”</p>

<p>At this direct question the owl turned its
head down upon the other shoulder, and
looked wiser than ever. Surely, he knew!</p>

<p>“But where?” cried the boy. “Tell me,
owl friend!”</p>

<p>But the bird said not a word. Only it
gazed at Faquo very seriously; and then,
turning its head as upon a pivot, began to
spruce up the feathers upon its back, as
much as to say: “Oh, that you must find
out for yourself, as I did.”</p>

<p>Such a wise bird, but so unspoken!
Really, how convenient it must be to be able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
to turn one’s head square around that way,
and look straight back! It must be that he
can even see that spot on the wall just behind
him and above his head—that round
place where the adobe is yellower than the
rest. Probably the plaster was broken
there, and they patched it.</p>

<p>Faquo got up idly, and set the owl carefully
to one side, and passed his hand over
the spot. It was somewhat larger than his
head—just a round patch of adobe plaster,
centuries old, yet evidently newer than the
rest of the wall.</p>

<p>He picked aimlessly at its edge. A pebble
came out under his fingers, and showed,
behind, a small crevice—as if a deep hole
had been filled up, instead of a little break
in the wall plaster. Instantly the boy’s
eyes waked up, and a queer, professional
look settled upon his face.</p>

<p>“It will be a wall niche,” he said gravely.
“And sometimes they filled them up to
change the wall; but why did the owl sit by
this one, if that was all?”</p>

<p>He pried and pulled until his fingers
were sore, and pounded with his fist upon
the yellow patch; but the adobe was very
stubborn. How aggravating to have the
spade perched away up there, when he
wanted to open this niche! For by now he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
had quite forgotten about getting out of his
prison. The strange fascination that all
miners know was upon him.</p>

<p>Plague take the spade! He picked up
again the strong lump of adobe which had
fallen with him from the upper wall, and
flung it at the offending spade. It struck
the sandy shelf, and a little stream of sand
fell down with the missile. That gave him
a thought; and he picked up his clod and
threw it again and again and again.</p>

<p>Each time it fell back a little smaller, but
each time a little more sand sifted down.
Then the sand, thus started, began frittering
down of its own accord, and the undermined
shovel began to creep, stopped, slid
a little, and at last pitched down and fell at
Faquo’s feet.</p>

<p>He jabbed at the adobe with the corner
of his spade, and the hard lumps showered
down upon his bare toes. In a few moments
a smooth-rimmed opening was revealed,
and he thrust in his arm.</p>

<p>It was not like any of the niches he knew—the
ones that have never been closed, but
remain as they were 500 years ago, when
the people of Pachacámac kept on these
odd shelves their ornaments and trinkets.
This one was like a nest of the “God-give-you”
bird—with a small opening, but large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
inside. In the big hollow was something
soft; and Faquo drew out his hand full of
beautiful yellow floss.</p>

<p>“The wool of the vicuña, only,” he mumbled,
disappointedly, but with the expert’s
air. “But why should they ceil <em>that</em> up?
Perhaps there is also cloth.”</p>

<p>In went the brown fist again; and rummaging
down through the silken fleece, his
fingers met something firmer. In a moment
he had it out—a long bundle of that matchless
weaving of old Peru; of cloth as soft
and strong as silk, woven with strange
figures of men and gods and beasts; such
fabrics as never unthinking loom has
woven, nor any machine less wondrous
than the fingers of a man.</p>

<p>“Ay! It will be worth twenty <i lang="es">soles</i>!”
cried Faquo softly. “But it is so heavy!
Perhaps they have wound it on a stone.”</p>

<p>Very tenderly he unrolled it, that none
of those bright threads—stronger than all
the centuries, but brittle to a careless touch—might
be broken. But when the last
fold came off, this very stupid Indian boy
fell down on his knees in the sand, and cried
and cried. For it was not a stone at all.</p>

<p class="tb">If you will go to the <i lang="es">Exposicion</i> in Lima,
among the bewildering collections of Peruvian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
antiquities, you can see two priceless
idols, each big as a large doll. They are
like human figures, excellently sculptured;
and the strangest thing about them is that
they are made of alternate zones of gold
and silver from feet to head, so that they
remind one of that great image we read of
in Revelations.</p>

<p>That is the nearest Faquito ever came to
finding the <i lang="es">Pez Grande</i>—and quite near
enough for one poor boy. And that is what
took my breath away when I had wakened
and hauled up with my reata the little,
ragged cholo I accidentally spied in the
trap where he had cried himself to sleep
over something hugged in his arms.</p>

<p>When he had laid the precious images
and the spade on the broad top of the wall,
and told me all about it, he insisted on being
lowered again on the rope to get the owl,
which he loosed and let go, saying, in the
tone of an old man:</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Taita Diós</i>—God our Father—sends us
friends we know not. For the owl brought
me here and showed me the place, so that
now we are very rich. And even so, I
could have died there without the help of
you. So I think your grace may be even as
wise as the owl, which knows where is the
<i lang="es">Pez Grande</i>.”</p>

<p>Probably they would not have seen
Ramon Ynga at all, but for the llamas.
There was enough else to look at. The
overpowering walls of the mountains on
both sides seemed to turn the eyes, even
as they turned the foaming Rimac, into a
channel from which there was no escape.
Up at the end of the cleft was such a sight
as no man can long hold his eyes from—the
black peak of Chin-chán, bent down with
its load of eternal winter. There is something
awful about the snow that never
melts—the great blank fields, the wrinkled
glaciers, the savage ice cornices, the black
rocks that peer out hopelessly here and
there. It is so different from the friendly
white we know and welcome for its sleigh
rides and coastings, its snow men and snow-ballings.</p>

<p>It was far up the summit of the Peruvian
cordillera, at the very foot of the last wild
peaks that stand 18,000 feet in the sky.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Where the panting mules trudged, 3,000
feet below the peaks, was low, green herbage;
and 500 feet lower yet the little torrent,
white as its mother snows, roared and
chuckled alternately to the uneven wind.
But up yonder all was so white and still;
their eyes kept lifting up to it, forgetful of
the dangerous trail—the mules could take
care of that. They, poor brutes, seemed
ill at ease. They breathed in short, loud
gasps; and every forty feet or so they
stopped and rested for a few moments, unmindful
of the spur. Then, when they
were ready, they started up again of their
own accord, sighing heavily. They would
not last much longer, at this rate.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll get off and walk awhile,”
said the younger of the two, a bronzed,
sinewy man of twenty-five. “It spoils even
this scenery for me, to see the suffering
of the mules. One wouldn’t think they’d
play out so, on such a good trail.”</p>

<p>“It is not the grade,” remarked the Professor,
quietly, “as perhaps you will learn.
<em>I</em> am sorry for the mules, too; but it is better
to risk them than something more important.”</p>

<p>“Why, you speak as though there were
some danger about it!” said the younger
man, who was now striding sturdily along,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
leaving his animal to follow. Many a time
he had climbed Pike’s Peak and its brother
giants of Colorado, and once had stood on
the cone of Popocatépetl. A peak was
nothing to him; and as for this excellent
path—pooh! It was mere child’s play.</p>

<p>The Professor watched him without a
word, but with an expression half quizzical,
half grave. After a hundred yards he
spoke:</p>

<p>“You don’t seem quite so springy, Barton.
I never saw <em>you</em> heavy-footed before.”</p>

<p>“Well, the truth is, Professor,” gasped
Barton, rather shamefacedly, “I feel most
remarkably queer. My knees ache as they
never did before—though I wouldn’t mind
that so much. But I cannot seem to breathe
well. Here my heart and lungs are pounding
away, as if I’d been sprinting for the
220-yard record! It’s enough to make a
man ashamed of himself.”</p>

<p>“No cause at all for shame, my dear boy;
you are simply learning what everyone has
to learn who tempts great altitudes. Now
get on your mule.”</p>

<p>“No, I’ll wear this thing off!” cried the
athlete, impatiently. “I’m no puny boy, to
give up just because I feel a little wrong.
I’ll just keep at it, and beat it yet!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>“Barton,” said the older man, in a tone
his companion had never heard him use
before, “you get on that mule, and let us
have no more nonsense. I like your pluck;
and it is because you have more real ‘sand’
(as they say in our West) than any young
man I know, that I picked you out for this
journey. But courage is a dangerous thing
unless you mix it with brains. You must
learn that there are some things pluck cannot
overcome—and this is one of them.
Mount, then!”</p>

<p>Barton obeyed with rather an ill grace,
and promptly got angrier with himself at
realizing what a relief it was to be perched
again in the ridiculously comfortable Peruvian
saddle. He could not get over a feeling
of shame that the muscles which had
borne the cruelest tests of the frontier
should now have “played the baby,” as he
put it; and he rode on somewhat sulkily.</p>

<p>It was here that Ramon Ynga stumbled
into their lives; and, as I have said, all by
the doing of the llamas. As the travelers
rounded a sharp turn in the trail the mules
stopped suddenly almost face to face with
the two strangest animals that Barton had
ever seen. Shabby, grotesque figures they
were, with splay feet, long, awkward legs,
and bodies looking like long tussocks of dry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
grass. But their necks were the worst—tall
and ungainly as stovepipes covered with
hair. Their backs were hardly so high as
those of the under-sized mules; but on these
unspeakable necks their heads were quite
on a level with Barton’s. And <em>such</em> heads!
They were disproportionately small and
ludicrously narrow, with pointed ears, malignant
little faces, and lips wickedly drawn
back.</p>

<p>“Why, I never saw anything, except a
rattlesnake, look so vindictive!” cried Barton.
“What on earth are they?”</p>

<p>“That is the national bird of Peru,” replied
the Professor roguishly. “We are
apt to see many up here. In fact, if we had
had any daylight in Casapalca you would
have noticed many hundreds of them; for
they bring all the ore to the stamp mills,
and do most of the freighting besides.
Lower than 10,000 feet you will hardly ever
find them; the llama<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> is a mountain animal,
and soon dies if taken to the coast.”</p>

<p>“So that is the llama! But I thought
that was called the ‘Peruvian sheep;’ and
these look no more like sheep than my mule
does.”</p>

<p>“It got that foolish name from the closet
naturalists. No one who ever saw a llama<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
could fail to recognize it for a camel—smaller
and longer-haired than the Eastern
beast, and without a hump; but a true
camel.”</p>

<p>“It’s a funny-looking brute,” laughed
Barton. “It seems to put in its time thinking
what a grudge it has against everybody.
Hi! Get out of the way, you standing
grievances!”</p>

<p>The Professor and the young frontiersman
had thus far enjoyed the pause of the
mules; but now the need of pushing on recurred
to their minds, and Barton’s exclamation
was meant as a signal for advance.
But the llamas stood stolidly, blocking the
trail. He drummed his spurs against his
mule; whereat the animal took two steps
forward and stopped, bracing back, unmindful
of the rowels. The llamas did not
take a step. Only they seemed to drop
their bodies a little, upon those long legs.</p>

<p>“Why, they’re not such fools as they
look!” cried Barton, whose sharp eye understood
the trifling motion. “See! They
are going to give us the edge!”</p>

<p>The trail was two feet wide—an endless
thread of a shelf hewn along the mountain
wall. On the right, the great, dark slope
ran up to the very clouds; on the left, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
could snap a pebble into the white torrent,
500 feet below.</p>

<p>“I have heard that they always take the
wall,” the Professor rejoined, “and that
when two llama trains meet on one of these
trails it is almost impossible to make a
passing. Sometimes they even shove each
other off the cliff.”</p>

<p>“I guess we’d better not force the right
of way—a tumble into the Rimac there is
more than I care for!” And Barton jumped
from his mule and advanced upon the blockaders,
waving his arms threateningly.</p>

<p>“Look out!” cried the Professor; but
before the words were fairly off his tongue,
the foremost llama opened its ugly mouth
and spat at Barton in fury. At this unpleasant
salutation he retreated hastily.</p>

<p>“That is their weapon of defense,” said
the Professor. “And their saliva is wonderfully
acrid. It’s as well you didn’t get
it in the face. But I wish they <em>would</em> get
out of the way—we have no time to spare.”</p>

<p>Just then there was another surprise. A
figure hardly less remarkable than the
camels slid down from the overhanging
hillside, and stood in the path, looking at
the startled travelers. It was a dwarfish
creature, not four feet tall, with a large,
round head, a broad, strong body, and very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
short legs, peculiarly bundled up in unfamiliar
clothes. A boy—what in the world
was he doing on that impossible slope?
What a goat he must be!</p>

<p>“Hulloa!” cried Barton, as soon as he
could find a voice.</p>

<p>“God give you good day, sirs,” answered
the lad gravely, in thick Spanish. “Wait
me so-little, and I will get you by.”</p>

<p>With this he called “U-pa!” to the llamas,
lifting his finger as if to point them up the
trail. Ordinarily they would have obeyed;
but the aggressive manner of Barton had
roused their obstinacy, and they did not
budge. The boy put his shoulder to the
ribs of one, and heaved hard, but the brute
stood its ground.</p>

<p>“Well, it is to wait!” said he; and ran
about the path, gathering up very small
pebbles until his shabby hat was full. Then
he sat down on a boulder that jutted from
the bank, settling himself as if for a long
rest, and threw a mild and measured pebble
at each llama. They turned their heads
a little and wrinkled their disagreeable
noses. He waited a moment and then
pitched two more pebbles—which had the
same effect. So he sat, slowly and mechanically
tossing his harmless missiles upon the
dense hair of his charges. Evidently he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
was in no hurry; and the two travelers, impatient
as they were, had too much wisdom
of experience to try to push him. They
sat quietly in their saddles, watching the
droll scene. It was very ridiculous to need
deliverance from two stupid beasts, and to
get it from such an owlish little tatterdemalion.
His ragged clothing was of very
thick, coarse cloth; and upon his feet were
the clumsy <i lang="es">yanquis</i>, or rawhide sandals of
mountain Peru, and he wore thick stockings
rising to his knees. Over his trousers was
a curious garment, half apron and half leggings;
and oversleeves of the same material,
hung with a cord about his neck, came up
over the elbows of his coat. These two
garments were knit in very strange patterns,
amid which were square, brown
llamas wandering up and down a gray background.
Around his waist was a woven
belt, now very old, but of beautiful colors
and workmanship. And his face—what a
brown, round riddle!</p>

<p>“How do you call yourself, friend?”
asked the Professor in Spanish. “And have
you ten years or a hundred?”</p>

<p>“Ramon Ynga, señor. And the other I
do not know. I have been here a long time—ever
since they built the mill at Casapalca.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“You must be about fifteen, then. And
where do you live?”</p>

<p>“There, above,” answered Ramon, tossing
another pebble.</p>

<p>“A curious habit of the mountaineers,”
said the Professor. “These Indians, instead
of living in the valleys, climb to the
very tops of these peaks, and build there
their squalid stone hovels. They seem to
think nothing of the eternal clambering up
and down.”</p>

<p>An hour crawled by, and the stones in
Ramon’s hat were running low. Suddenly
the brown llama turned with a snort of disgust,
and strode off up the trail. The white
one hesitated a moment, snorted, and followed.
“That way they get tired, sirs,”
said the boy, emptying his hat and pulling
it down upon his thatch of black hair.</p>

<p>“I’d take a good club to them!” growled
Barton, who had great confidence in the
Saxon way of forcing things.</p>

<p>“No, the boy is quite right. It is another
case wherein you must not try to be smarter
than nature. The llama is the stubbornest
brute alive—a mule is vacillating compared
to him. If you put a pound too much on his
load, he will lie down, and you might beat
him to death or build a fire beside him, but
he would not get up. Nobody but a Peruvian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Indian can do anything with a Peruvian
camel, and Ramon has just shown us
the proper tactics. Hurt the animal, and
he only grows more sullen; but the pebbles
merely tease him until he can bear it no
longer. And really he repays patience; for
he is the only animal that can work effectively
at these altitudes, where horses and
mules are practically useless. But <i lang="es">adelante</i>!
(forward!)”</p>

<p>“Is your Excellency going to Cerro de
Pasco?” asked the little Peruvian, running
alongside the mule and looking up at the
Professor with unusual animation in his
non-committal face. He had never spoken
with “Yankees” before, and indeed for
any stranger to notice him kindly was a
new experience. He liked these pale men;
and a dim little wish to please them warmed
in his heart. That big young man—why,
he was taller than any Serrano in the
cordillera!—was good. Ramon had seen
money a few times; but that round, shiny
<i lang="es">sol</i>,<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> which the stranger had tossed him
when the llamas moved, was the first he
had ever held in his hand; and it was almost
a worry to be so rich! But the other man,
with a little gray above his ears, who only
looked at him <em>so</em>, and spoke as if he knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
him—he, surely, was very great; and it
was to him that the ragged boy had said
“<i lang="es">Exceléncia.</i>” His face was kindly; and
there were little smiles at the edges of his
mouth, though he did not laugh.</p>

<p>“No, <i lang="es">hijito</i> (little son),” he answered,
“we are not bound to the mines. We are
going to climb the Chin-chán, to look at the
ice cornices and to measure them.”</p>

<p>Even Ramon looked astonished at this.
If a Serrano had said it, every one would
know he was crazy. Or if it were the young
man—well, what could you expect of one
who would give away a whole <i lang="es">sol</i>? But this
one—whatever <em>he</em> did, it must be right.
He certainly was not crazy. Still——</p>

<p>“But the Soroche, your Excellency,” ventured
the boy. “For all strangers have it;
and many die, even in crossing the slope.
Only we who were born here can go so
high.”</p>

<p>“We have to go, my boy; for I must look
at the snow fields and the cliffs of ice, and
measure them,” said the Professor, kindly.
“I know well of the mountain sickness, and
we will be very careful. Besides, we are
both very strong.”</p>

<p class="caption">THE HOME OF THE SOROCHE</p>
</div>

<p>“It is not always of the strong,” persisted
Ramon. “Sometimes the sick cross
in safety, and those who are very large and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
red—even larger than your Excellency’s
friend—fall suddenly and never rise again;
for the Soroche is stronger than any.”</p>

<p>“You are quite right, my wise friend.
It is terrible. But all do not fall victims,
and we must brave it.”</p>

<p>“At the least, Excellency, let me go also!
For I know these hills very well, and perhaps
I could help. As for the llamas, my
brother Sancho comes even yonder, and he
will herd them.”</p>

<p>“You won’t really take the little rat up
there, will you, Professor?” broke in Barton.
“It would be the death of him.”</p>

<p>“M-m! I only hope we may be as safe
as I know he will be! <i lang="es">Está bien</i>, my boy!
<i lang="es">Vamos!</i>”<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p class="tb">At nine the next morning the three were
entering the edge of the snow fields. They
had camped for the night in a deserted
hovel at the head of the valley; and there
the mules could be seen grazing, pulling as
far down bill as their ropes would allow.
The hut was not a mile behind; but the
travelers had been ever since daylight coming
thus far. The Professor looked old;
and Barton’s big chest was heaving violently.
As for Ramon, he clambered along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
steadily and soberly, stopping only when he
saw the others had stopped.</p>

<p>By noon they were at the foot of the last
ridge, in a great rounding bay flanked by
two spurs of the upper peak. The curving
rim far overhead was a savage cliff of eternal
ice—a cliff of 1,500 feet sheer. At the
top a great white brow projected many
yards, overhanging the bluish precipice.</p>

<p>“It is—a—noble—cornice,” gasped the
Professor, as they sank upon the snow to
rest for the hundredth time since morning.
“But I fear—we—made—a mistake. We—should—not
have—tried this—without—waiting
a—few weeks—in Casa—palca—to
get—acclimated.”</p>

<p>“It’s awful!” groaned Barton. “My
head—feels—as if—it would—burst.
But I’ll be hanged—if I—give up!” And
the resolute young man fairly snatched
himself to erectness, and started toward
the spur. But with the third step his tall
form swung half around, and swayed an
instant, and fell as a dead pine falls in the
wind, and lay heavily upon the snow. His
face was black; and a bright red stream
trickled from each nostril as the Professor
sank on his knees beside him, crying huskily,
“My—poor boy! I have—killed—you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>The Professor’s face had a strange look,
too. His eyes were very red and swollen—but
that was from the merciless glare of
the snow—and in his cheeks a gray shadow
seemed to be struggling with the unnatural
purple. And he was so unlike the Professor
of yesterday. He seemed so dull; even
stupid!</p>

<p>“Come, Excellency!” Ramon was shouting
in his ear. “It is the Soroche, the
mountain sickness, and none can fight it.
We must be gone from here, else very soon
you are both dead. Come!” The small
brown fist was tugging at the old man’s
shoulder, and in the quaint, boyish voice
was a strange thrill. The Professor understood.
Dazed as he was, the way in which
Ramon said that one word “Come” roused
and cheered him like the far bugle call
which tells of reinforcements to the besieged.
He was not alone. Here was help—the
help of a dwarfed Indian boy of fifteen!
But that is often the very sort we need—not
muscle so much as the elbow-touch of a
staunch heart.</p>

<p>“But—Barton?” said the Professor. He
could no longer think clearly; and instinctively
he turned to Ramon as superior.
“Barton? We—cannot—leave—Barton!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
The Serrano lad looked at the prostrate
figure and then at the Professor.</p>

<p>But even in those bloodshot eyes Ramon
read something that decided him. It was
very hard, and it was more dangerous so;
but the Friend-man loved the other. The
other must be tried for too!</p>

<p>Ramon unwound his long woven belt and
passed it under Barton’s back. The ends
he drew up under the armpits and crossed
them at the back of the neck, giving one end
to the Professor and keeping one himself.
Then, when they pulled apart, the crossing
of the belt supported Barton’s head.
“Now!” cried Ramon; and pulling strongly
the two dragged the heavy form along the
snow to the edge of the steep slope. The
Professor’s face was purple, and drops of
blood beaded his finger tips.</p>

<p>“Let me, señor!” said the boy; and
taking both ends of the belt over his shoulder,
he went plunging down the declivity,
Barton’s limp head bumping against his
legs, and Barton’s body and heels dragging
in the soft snow just enough to act as a
brake. As for the Professor, he stumbled
after as best he could, with vague eyes and
bursting veins and treacherous legs. Sometimes
he fell forward and plowed a rod in
the snow, and once he was beginning to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
roll, but Ramon leaped and stopped him
just in time.</p>

<p>And so at last they came to the end of the
snow. The boy laid his burden upon the
matted grass, with head up-hill, and piled a
little drift of snow about the head. “Put
it so, also, to your head,” said he, “and I will
bring the mules.”</p>

<p>With that he was racing off down the hill
in knowing zigzags, though it looked too
steep for a goat.</p>

<p>In half an hour a very tired boy was getting
two helpless men upon two almost
helpless mules. Perhaps if the latter had
been able to object, he could not have succeeded.
But by the help of the slope, and
hauling with his belt over the saddle from
the down-hill side, he presently had both
up. Barton’s feet he tied together under
the mule, and Barton’s hands around its
neck. The Professor could sit up, in a
stupid way, and Ramon tied only his feet.
“Hold well!” he cried loudly and sternly,
but with the same little quiver in his voice;
and taking both bridle reins in one hand, he
plunged down the hill, his weight thrown
forward upon the hard bits, so that the reluctant
mules had no choice but to follow.</p>

<p>The only one who remembers much of
that grim journey is Ramon, and as he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
not much given to talking, no one knows
just what he does think of it. The Professor’s
clear recollection begins with finding
himself on board the train at Casapalca—a
train of that most wonderful railroad in the
world, the railroad above the clouds, that
clambers up and burrows through the cordillera
of Peru. Before that are only hazy
memories of a vast mountain wall leaning
over to crush him; a winding path in the
air; a queer, boy’s voice, coming from nowhere,
with little Spanish words of cheer.
And now a round, brown face from the opposite
seat was watching him seriously—even
tenderly, the Professor fancied—while
the burly conductor was saying:</p>

<p>“I never seen it come any closer! How
ever the boy got you in, beats my time.
And I saw he hated to leave you, so I says
to him, says I, ‘Just get in, sonny, ’n’ go
down to Lima with us, ’n’ I’ll fetch you
back if I lose my job!’ He’s the right sort,
he is! An’ you’ll be all right, as soon as
you get down there—that’s the only medicine
for the S’rochy.”</p>

<p>All right they were next day in the capital.
Even Barton was able to sit up; and he
nodded weakly as the Professor said to
Ramon:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“My boy, I would like you to go with us.
We have to travel much in Peru; and if you
will accompany us you will earn good wages.
And you shall be as my son. For neither of
us would be alive now if we had not had a
little hero with us. Will you come?”</p>

<p>Joy flashed over Ramon’s face. But then
it faded, and tears started in his eyes as he
said simply:</p>

<p>“You are good, Excellency! I would go
<em>anywhere</em> with you. But in the Chin-chán
is my mother, with the babies; and since
father died, I must be the man, for Sancho
is too young. <i lang="es">Adios!</i>”</p>

<p>And he ran out, so that they should not
see him crying.</p>

<h3>A Daughter of the Misti.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 50px;">
<img src="images/deco-chap.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Not the elder daughter, whom all the
world knows where she sits, white
upon her little green patch against the
hopeless desert, looking up with now and
then a shiver at the white-headed giant, her
father. No, the one I mean now is something
like three hundred and fifty years
younger than the Misti’s first born and
favorite, and not white at all, nor over-dignified,
nor even given to much thought
as to when <i lang="es">taita</i><a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> shall shrug again those
mighty shoulders and rattle the walls about
her ears. In fact, to look at the two—the
fat, brown, clumsy <i lang="es">cholo</i> girl and the shining
city—I dare say you would never take
Tránsita and Arequipa<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> for sisters at all.
But as both are daughters of the Misti, I see
no other way out of it.</p>

<p>What! You don’t know either of them?
Hm! Of course it could hardly be expected
that you should be acquainted with Tránsita,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
for she lives on a back street on the
other side of the river and comes very seldom
to the plaza. And probably you could
not talk with her, anyhow, since her speech
is only Spanish and Quichua. But not to
know Arequipa—why that is to count out
the prettiest city in Peru, and one of the
oldest in America. And if you do not know
the daughter you have missed the father,
too, which is an even greater pity—for
he is one of the handsomest giants on earth,
though a baby in his own family. Well,
well—the sooner I give you an introduction
the better, then.</p>

<p>The Misti is an inactive but living volcano,
a hundred miles from the sea, in
southern Peru. As I have said, it ranks
small at home, being only 19,300 feet tall,
while some of its brother Andes tower to
26,000 feet. But few of them are so handsome.
It stands alone and erect, with head
up and shoulders squared, while some of
them look as if the nurse had dropped them
in their babyhood and they had never got
their spines straight again. It is a huge
and very perfect cone, symmetrical as the
sacred peak of Japan, but vastly higher.
So steep is it that the thick blanket of volcanic
cinders would surely slip down from
its shoulders, except for the long brooches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
of dead lava that pin it up. As for its head,
that is old with eternal snow.</p>

<p>For time unknown—since long before
history—the Misti has been the best known
mountain in Peru; and I do not much wonder.
It has a nobility of its own, such as its
mightier brethren do not all possess. Just
to its right vast Charchani climbs 20,000
feet into the sky, and a most majestic peak
it is. Just to its left towers the grand wall
of Pichu-pichu, itself taller than the greatest
mountain in the United States. But it is
always the lone, solemn Misti, to which
every one looks, of which every one speaks—with
a strange mixture of love and awe.
Meeting an Arequipeño abroad, you might
very likely fancy there were no other mountains
in sight of his home; but you will not
be left long in ignorance that there is a
Misti. Even before Europeans knew of
America, the remarkable Indians of Peru
half worshiped the Misti; and so Arequipa
gets its name, an Aymará word which
means “with the peak behind it.” Far up
its deadly sides they toiled to make their
sacrifices to Those Above; and even in the
elder crater I have counted the ruins of
aboriginal shrines. It is so isolated, so individual,
so majestic in its awful stature;
and above all, while its neighbor brothers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
are just mountains, it has a soul—the wondrous
fire-soul of the volcano.</p>

<p>A stern father is the Misti. His daughter
is surely not undutiful, but many a time
he has punished her sorely. Many a time
he has sent her sprawling in the dust, and
turned her smiling whiteness to a generation
of mourning. So, even as late as 1868
over half the buildings of Arequipa went
down in a mortal chaos of stone, killing as
many people as fall in an ordinary battle.</p>

<p>One might fancy that such a parent would
get himself disliked; but his severity does
not seem to be laid up against him. Arequipa
loves the Misti—and as for Tránsita,
she loved him even more than she did Arequipa.
Their house faced south, but the first
thing in the morning Tránsita used to climb
to the stone-arched roof to look at the peak
black against the rising sun; and the last
thing at evening to watch the rosy west-glow
upon that venerable head. And always
she wondered the more, for now as she
grew taller, and the untaught soul had room
to swell, she saw more and more in that
great dark one with his elephant-wrinkled
hide and the lava scars on his white head,
and now and then, of a hushed dawn, the
ghost of a cloud floating plume-like from
his brow. Perhaps it was because he is so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
incomprehensible a giant that she comprehended
him—in that child way which is
more at home in some mysteries than we
older stupids are. At all events, she turned
to him for companionship and confidences,
and had a way of talking with him ever so
softly, that no one else should hear.</p>

<p>“Now, <i lang="es">taita</i>,” she was whispering this
morning, “hast thou heard what is to be?
For they say that the <i lang="es">Tuerto</i>, the cross-eyed,
who oppressed us before, is to make
new revolution, that he may be president
again and rob himself still richer. And it
has always been in Arequipa that they
begin. Dost thou think it? And would
they kill Eugénio? For he is very loyal,
and is one of importance, being a corporal.
Do not let them hurt my brother—wilt
thou, <i lang="es">taita</i>?”</p>

<p>To all these questions and the adjuration
the giant answered never a word. His face
was grave with the morning shadows. To
look at him no one but Tránsita would
have dreamed he knew anything about it.</p>

<p>Nor do I really know that he did, though
he had the best of opportunities. From
that lookout in the sky, so overtopping the
town, he could see right into the high-walled
court of Don Telesfor’s mansion. It was a
flat old courtyard, paved with tipsy blocks of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
stone and framed four-square with long
shadowy verandas of the white <i lang="es">sillar</i>.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> In
the center was a long-forgotten fountain,
and at the middle of each side a quaint
staircase of the same white tufa ran up to
the cracked and precarious <i lang="es">sillar</i> roof. No
one was to be seen about the court. Only,
along the eastern <i lang="es">portal</i><a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> was a long ridge
of fresh earth.</p>

<p>Don Telesfor was making repairs. A
great many people in Arequipa had long
been free to say that he ought to mend his
ways, and the old place might certainly
count as a way that should be mended. His
career as prefect, years before, had been
by no means free from charges of extortion
and thievery, and it was notorious that
he would be glad to see again in the presidential
chair the unscrupulous usurper who
had grown from pauper soldier to many-times
millionaire in one term. For this
reason Don Telesfor was as little beloved
as his old patron; and poor <i lang="es">cholos</i>, with
better love than understanding of freedom,
took malicious pleasure in laying the
scourge to their two backs jointly. “Look
at the Cacerist!” they would growl audibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
when Don Telesfor thundered down the
reeling cobblestones on his silver trapped
horse. As for his house, I fancy not one of
them ever passed it after nightfall, with a
bit of chalk in his pocket (and chalk is the
last thing to be without in Peru during a
campaign), but he stopped and scrawled in
elastic Spanish upon the outer wall: “Death
to the tyrant and his leeches! Down with
the cross-eyed!”</p>

<p>But though he was unpopular in person
and politics, no one thought of taking Don
Telesfor very seriously. Like his patron,
he had turned tail when the Chilean wolves
came down on the fold; and unlike him, his
caution was greater than his greed. Every
one knew him for timorous. The unhappy
republic was torn and pale with fear of a
new usurpation; but in all the whisperings
and the glances over the shoulder, Don
Telesfor was quite forgotten. Since the
downfall of the pretender he had been
quietly cultivating his pretty <i lang="es">chacra</i> at
Yura, and now even thought to patch up
the old mansion in Arequipa, long tousled
and neglected since the terrible <i lang="es">temblor</i> of
’68. This was praiseworthy and reassuring,
too. In those troublous times to think
rather of beautifying and restoring the
home was clearly a pledge of peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Sober burros, each laden with two big
white blocks of <i lang="es">sillar</i>, had been trudging
down from the lofty quarries, and the tottering
arches of the courtyard had been rebuilt.
Now, Don Telesfor was hauling rich
soil all the way from his plantation to make
flower beds in the <i lang="es">patio</i>.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Some felt that
the soil of Arequipa ought to be good enough
for any flower; but if he chose to haul dirt
twelve miles instead of one, that was his
lookout. So the crazy wagons creaked
across the ancient stone bridge every afternoon
and bumped into the courtyard, and
were relieved of their mules. Don Telesfor
was always on hand in person to attend to
the unloading—he and his nephew, Don
Beltran, and two old peons—while the
drivers took their animals to the <i lang="es">acéquia</i>.
One would have thought that loam sacred,
by the care he took of it.</p>

<p>Just now the big gates were shut. The
wagons would not be in from Yura for some
time yet. Along the east side of the <i lang="es">patio</i>
was the long mound of soil, paling in the
hot sun; aside from that, one might have
thought the place abandoned.</p>

<p>But if one could have peered through the
heavy doors of the middle room of the north
portal one would have seen Don Telesfor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
and Don Beltran and half a dozen strangers
talking low and earnestly. The windows
and even the skylight were shuttered, and
the one candle sent strange shadows
sprawling over a formidable row of long,
shallow, iron-bound boxes stained with
fresh earth.</p>

<p>“To-morrow night, then,” said one of the
strangers, laying his hand on Don Telesfor’s
shoulder. “Even so it will begin in
Lima on the eve of the new congress, and
all is set that the revolution burst in the
same hour in Truxillo, Cuzco, here and all
Peru. And carrying it off well here in the
south, who knows but Don Telesfor shall
earn a place in the new cabinet?”</p>

<p>“Ójala!” sighed Don Telesfor, his mouth
twitching greedily. “At all events, this
end is safe. I promise you no one so much
as suspects us, and with the two hundred
men that will sleep here to-night hidden,
we can easily put down any resistance.
The <i lang="es">guárdias</i> are the only danger; for,
being <i lang="es">cholos</i><a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> they all worship Piérola, and
it avails not the trying to buy them. The
only argument with such stupids is to rap
them the back of the head—and for that,
thirty secure men are appointed to hide
upon the beat and silence each his policeman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
By midnight that should all be settled
without noise, and then we will fall
upon the barracks. A hundred soldiers,
asleep, have nothing to say with us; and in
the morning Arequipa will waken to find
herself in our ranks.”</p>

<p>“Nothing lacks, then?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. All is understood. Forty
rifles are still to come, but they will be here
in an hour, or maybe two, for the carts
move slowly.”</p>

<p>“And then the flower beds will be done,
no?” chuckled the other with a wink.</p>

<p>“Aye, and ready to bloom,” answered
Don Telesfor, smiling grimly at the jest.</p>

<p>“And, methinks, with enough thorns—<i lang="es">ay
diós!</i> What?”</p>

<p>For a deep, far roar crept through the
closed shutters; a Babel of howling curs
and crowing cocks and the jangle of church
bells. Before one could fairly turn to look
at his neighbor it was as if that whole room
of stone had suddenly been dropped twenty
feet, as one might drop a bird cage to the
floor. The heavy boxes and the standing
men and the massive furniture were tossed
as feathers in a gust of air. The wide
stone vault overhead yawned and let in a
foot of sky, and shivered as if to fall, and
then as swiftly clapped its ragged teeth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
shut again, while a great dust filled the
room to choking. Then all was still as the
grave, and for a few seconds nothing moved.
At last the men scrambled to their feet,
pale and hushed, and stood looking blankly
at one another.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Ea!</i> But I like not your Arequipa temperament,”
faltered the tallest of the strangers.
“It is too impulsive. Not if you
gave me three Arequipas would I dwell
here!”</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Pues</i>, it is nothing,” answered Don
Telesfor, coolly. “Only in the being accustomed.
These <i lang="es">temblores</i> are fearsome,
but we think little of them. To the street,
when the shock comes, lest the walls thump
us on the heads; and then back into the
house, as if there had been nothing. As
for this one, it is a good omen. El Misti
gives us the hand that he is with us for an
overturning.”</p>

<p class="tb">Tránsita, sitting upon the stone coping of
her own roof, had a clearer view of the
earthquake, and her opinion certainly did
not coincide with that of Don Telesfor. It
was a perfect day, as most days in Arequipa
are, but something in the air made
her nervous and ill at ease, and all the
morning she had been perched up there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
confiding her fears to the great peak. Below,
the street was still echoing the rumble
of clumsy carts high heaped with earth.
She had paid little attention to them or their
clamor. Her thoughts were for Eugénio,
and her anxiety about him seemed to grow.
So groundlessly, too. The national unrest
was everywhere, but vague and undefined.
No one knew any specific cause for alarm,
and she least of all. Now, if her ears had
been sharp enough to hark across to that
barred room a mile away, where Don Telesfor
was at that very moment saying: “The
only argument with such stupids is to rap
them the back of the head.” And “such
stupids” meant precisely Eugénio and his
fellow-soldiers, the military police of the
city.</p>

<p>Six wagons had already turned the corner
toward the bridge and were out of sight.
As the straggling seventh and last trundled
past the house the teamster, seeing that
squat figure up there, tossed at it a pebble
from his load. Tránsita only shrugged her
shoulder at the tap. She was too busy with
her thoughts to so much as turn around.
“Much care of Eugénio,” she murmured.
“And if truly there be of these Cacerists
here, confound them, <i lang="es">taita</i>!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>As she raised her eyes to the great peak
a swift chill ran through her. She was sure
the Misti nodded, as if he had heard her
words. Surely the giant moved! Far spurts
of dust rose from his shoulders, and dark
masses came leaping down, and the great
profile seemed to lose its sharpness. She
winked hard to be sure of her eyes, and now
the Misti moved no more. But from the
corrals roundabout rose a bedlam; and
Chopo ran out, barking frantically, and the
ancient cottonwoods up by the mill suddenly
bowed their heads as to a hurricane.
The <i lang="es">acéquia</i> bank split and the stream came
panicking out. The tall wall back of Eusébio’s
house was rent from top to bottom,
and two-foot blocks of <i lang="es">sillar</i> flew all about.
The very roof on which she sat—a massive
arch of stone, as are nearly all the roofs of
Arequipa—went up and down as if a heavy
wave had passed under it. The coping
spilled into the street; and Tránsita was
left clinging on the broken edge, her face
hanging over. There were wild screams,
and every one stood, as by magic, in the
middle of the street, looking up at the tottering
walls. And in the self-same breath
it was all done, and no sign was left save the
shattered blocks of stone, the truant <i lang="es">acéquia</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
and a tall cloud of yellow dust that went
bellying off toward Charchani.</p>

<p>Yes, one thing more. Tránsita lay bewildered
a moment, and then began to look
about, still without moving. Every one was
going back into the houses, laughing nervously,
a few children crying. In another
moment the street was deserted. It was as
if that thousand people had been a return-ball,
to pop one instant into sight, and in
another back with the recoil of the elastic.
But down by the empty hovels over the way
was a cart, broken across in halves. Two
dazed mules were trying clumsily to right
themselves with the forward end of the
wreck, while the rear half was tossed up on
the narrow sidewalk against the ruined
walls. The load of earth had been unceremoniously
dumped into the gutter, and the
<i lang="es">cholo</i> driver, half overwhelmed by it, lay
motionless along the curb.</p>

<p>At that, Tránsita was upon her feet at
once, nor paused until she was tugging at
the teamster’s arms. The dirt was heaped
upon his legs, and he had fainted with the
pain, and such a dead weight she could not
budge. She dropped the limp shoulders and
began to claw the loose earth away. In a
moment the left foot was free; but as she
dragged it out, the dirt slipped down and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
revealed the corner of an iron-bound box
resting upon the other leg. A sudden impulse
led her to sweep back the soil until
the end of the case was uncovered. The
funny black marks there meant nothing to
Tránsita—indeed, if any one had spelled
out for her the “M-a-double-n-l-i-c-h-e-r,” I
seriously doubt if that grewsome German
name would have made her any the wiser.
But if she did not know letters from ten-penny
nails, and was equally ignorant of
the inventions and the existence of Germany,
Tránsita was no fool. For a moment
her brown face looked more than usually
dull. Then a slow grayness crept into it,
and there was a hitch in her breath.</p>

<p>She looked up at the Misti appealingly,
and then down at the box, staring as if fascinated.
Presently the rather heavy jaw
set stubbornly. She lifted the corner of
the box an inch, by a violent effort, pried
her shin against the sharp edge to hold it,
and laboriously dragged out the imprisoned
foot. Then she scraped the earth over
until the box was well hidden again, and
leaving the liberated but unconscious teamster
where he lay, went racing down the
street like one gone daft.</p>

<p class="tb">“This is a pretty story to bring to the
<i lang="es">cuartel</i>, daughterling,” said Captain Yrribarri,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
fifteen minutes later. Corporal Eugénio
had no sooner heard his sister’s
breathless message than he brought her
before the commanding officer, and there
she had rehearsed it all, unshaken by questionings
and banter. “It has to be true,”
she declared, over and over, “else <i lang="es">mi taita</i>
Misti never would have showed me.”</p>

<p>“A girl’s nonsense,” the grave officer
repeated. “And still—what do <em>any</em> boxes,
thus hidden in loads of earth, and in these
times? I mind me, now, that Don Telesfor
has been hauling earth all the way from
Yura these many weeks, when there is
better at Carmen Alto. It is fit to be looked
into, and by the saints, if thy guess is true,
little one, thou shalt be corporal, or thy
brother sergeant! <i lang="es">Oyez</i>, Eugénio! With
a squad of thirty men surround Don Telesfor’s
house and hold it tight that it leak not,
while Pedro goes with five to verify the
cart and the box. If that is nothing, they
will report to you and you will return to
quarters with the tongue behind the teeth;
but if they shall find arms in the cart, keep
the house and warn me.”</p>

<p>For my own part, I do not overly love the
soldier-police of Arequipa, and have sometimes
been angry enough to want to choke
them for murdering my sleep with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
abominable midnight whistles. But after
all, I am glad that they were not all knocked
on the head the night after the earthquake;
for in spite of their ignorance and their skin
and their ear-piercing way of announcing
“All’s well,” they are a kindly, honest,
well meaning set, who could be much better
utilized than by clubbing. And particularly
Eugénio, who is a very good boy and likes
to talk with me, calling me “your grace.”
He has told me many interesting things,
and often sent a <i lang="es">cholo</i> to “tote” my heavy
camera around. Sergeant Eugénio now,
please—for Tránsita declined to be a corporal
when the search revealed not only the
one case of Mannlicher rifles in the dirt
under the wrecked cart, but thirty cases
more in Don Telesfor’s house, along with
papers which left no doubt of his treason.
Some fellow-conspirator must have warned
him in time of the wayside accident, for
though Eugénio and his men kept the house
fully surrounded until a report came from
the cart, when they broke in there was not
a soul to be found.</p>

<p>None of the other plotters were known,
and Don Telesfor eluded pursuit. It may
or may not be true, as, I have been told, that
he took asylum in Bolivia and was afterward
drowned in trying to ford the Choqueyapu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
during a freshet; but, at all events,
he never came back to revive his nipped
revolution.</p>

<p>As for Tránsita, you might just as well
try to tell her that the Misti is not there at
all as that “He” did not specially and intentionally
interpose to save the peace of
his daughters and the head of Eugénio. I
half believe her brother is secretly of the
same opinion, for the superstition of the
peak is very strong in Arequipa; though he
shrugs his shoulders in a deprecatory way
when put the direct question, and says evasively:</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Pues</i>, who knows? So the women declare.
For me it is enough that he did it,
and in time, the same as if he knew.”</p>

<p>“Tchu! ’stá-te!” cried Josefa,<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
straightening up from her work
and looking severely at a small brown
rogue who had climbed up to the little shelf
over the corner fireplace. The adobe floor
was spattered with big drops of water, to
lay the dust; and Josefa, bent half double
to reach it with the short wisp of broom
corn which serves in New Mexican homes,
was sweeping toward the door the fine
gray powder that works up daily from the
compact clay.</p>

<p>“Give me that little stone, <i lang="es">nana</i>,” begged
the boy. “The one <i lang="es">tata</i> carries in his
pouch when he goes to hunt.”</p>

<p>“Get away, quick, for that is the charm
of the Magic Deer! Much care! For if
ever thou touch that, thy grandfather will
see to thee!”</p>

<p>Anastácio clambered down reluctantly
from the old chair, and went outside to play
with the burro. But the stone weighed on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
his mind. It was a very ordinary-looking
pebble, gray, light, porous, and without any
particular shape—looking, in fact, like one
of the pieces of pumice which were so common
in the mountains. But somehow it
had a fascination for Anastácio. And that
evening, when we all sat by the crackling
fire, he climbed on his grandfather’s knee
and said:</p>

<p>“Go, <i lang="es">tata</i>, tell me what is this stone of
the Magic Deer, that I may not play with
it.”</p>

<p>“To play with <em>that</em>?” exclaimed Don
José, in a tone of horror. “Child! That
little stone is very precious. For no other
hunter in New Mexico has the like; and if it
were lost or broken, we should be ruined,
since only with it is it possible to kill the
deer which are enchanted, as are many.
And to get that stone I passed a sad time.”</p>

<p>“How? Where? When? With the Enchanted
Deer? Tell me, <i lang="es">tatita</i>!”</p>

<p>“Yes, with the <i lang="es">Venado Encantado</i>, and in
many ways.” And Don José, the luckiest
hunter in Rio Arriba, a gray-headed but
sharp-eyed Mexican—whom I count a
staunch friend and a brave man, even if he
does believe some things I do not—nodded
to me, as if for permission to tell the story.
I had often heard of the Witch Deer, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
knew that a very large proportion of the
natives of New Mexico believe firmly in
this and in many other forms of witchcraft.
I knew, too, that Don José was a scrupulously
truthful man. The years of our acquaintance
had proved that beyond doubt.
Whatever in his story might be supernatural
would have to be charged to his
faith, and not to any intention of deceiving.</p>

<p>“You must know, Don Carlos,” said he,
“that while there are many witches here,
there is one kind that delights most to vex
hunters. Without doubt you also will have
seen the Enchanted Deer, as much as you
hunt.”</p>

<p>“No,” I answered. “I have never seen
one, but I have heard of them all over New
Mexico these five years.”</p>

<p>“Sure! For there are many; and many
have lost their lives thereby, for the Witch
Deer is more dangerous than bear or mountain
lion. Only when one has the stone
which they wear in the first fork of their
horns is it possible to conquer them, for
that makes one not to be seen.”</p>

<p>“But I can see you, Don José,” I interrupted,
smiling, as he held up the magic
stone.</p>

<p>“But, friend, that is different! For it is
only in its use. Now I <em>want</em> you to see me;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
but when I carry this no deer in the sierra
has eyes for me, and I could walk even up
to them, taking care only that they scented
me not.”</p>

<p>It is worse than useless to argue against
these beliefs. Don José would never be
convinced, and the incredulity of a friend
could only hurt his feelings, and, besides
being ill-mannered, further caviling would
lose me a story, so I said, simply:</p>

<p>“All right, <i lang="es">compadre</i>, tell us all about it.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, thus it was, and you shall see
I am right. It makes many years now, for
it was long before I married me with Josefa,
in the year of ’67. Her father was Alcalde
of Abiquiu<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>; and there lived my parents
also. When I was a young man, already
grown, strong—as you may yet see—and
well taught in the ways of hunting, I came
often to these mountains for game; and our
house was never without dried meat in
plenty. There was one that hunted with
me, and they always called him <i lang="es">Cabezudo</i>,
because of his strong head; but in truth he
was Luís Delgado, a cousin of me. In
heart we were as brothers, and either
would give his life for the other. Often the
old men of Abiquiu told us of the Witch
Deer, which could never be killed unless by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
a hunter unseen; and Luís answered always:
‘Aha! When there is a deer too strong
for this rifle, let him eat me.’ For, you see,
he believed not in witches. This was the
only thing we ever quarreled about—that he
was without faith.</p>

<p>“It came that in October of the year ’60
we were together camped in the Valles, and
with much care, since the Navajos were
bad. We had a house of logs, very strong,
and in it already was a wonder of dried
meat of deer and bear. We went forth
always together, for fear of the Indians,
but by good luck they molested us not. As
for game, I think there was never such a
year.</p>

<p>“One day, when the first snow was three
hours old, we came to a round <i lang="es">mesa</i> that
stood on the plateau, and near the foot of it
were tracks of a deer. But alas! I knew
then that it was no true deer, for its footprints
were great as those of a horse. ‘It
will be the Venado Encantado,’ said I to
Luís. ‘Let us go the other way!’ But he
said: ‘<em>What</em> Enchanted Deer, nor yet what
mouse-traps? Get out! I thought thee a
man! Thou that only yesterday didst kill,
with dagger alone, the great she-bear, and
now wouldst run from a deer track!’ And
it was true; for since the bear, well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
wounded, was upon us before there was
room to reload, I had the luck to compose
her with my hunting-knife.</p>

<p>“Wrong of me it was, but I had shame
at the words of Luís, and followed him.
‘Truly this is grandfather of all the deer!’
he cried. ‘For never have I seen such
tracks. And his horns we will take to Abiquiu,
though they shall weigh like a tree.
Come on!’</p>

<p>“With that we pursued the tracks, wondering
always at their greatness. They
went a little around the foot of the mesa,
and then up a steep way to its top. When
we came to the top, where was a cleft in the
rocks, so that one could get up, we found a
large level place, round, and with a rim of
cliffs below, so that nowhere else was it
possible to reach the summit. The trail
went away among the junipers, and we followed
it cautiously, knowing that the deer
must be here, since no tracks led down.
And of a sudden, crawling around a clump
of trees, we stood before him. Ay, señor!
How great he was! Great as a tall horse,
and upon his head the keys [horns] were as
the branches of a blasted cedar. There he
stood, a thing of fifty yards away, looking
at us with his head high, as if mocking.
My heart forgot its count; for truly he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
no thing of this earth—that beast with a
look so cunning and so terrible.</p>

<p>“‘What a beast!’ Luís whispered. ‘At
the throat, to break his neck. But save
thou thy fire, for in case’—and putting his
rifle firm as a rock, he fired. But as the
smoke blew by, there stood the deer, wagging
himself the head scornfully, for the
bullet had rebounded from him. So it is
with these beasts that are witches, for when
they see you, no ball will enter their hide.
And then, putting down his head till that
the horns lacked but a foot from the ground,
he came like a large rock leaping down the
mountain.</p>

<p>“Now I knew well that he was no mortal
thing, and that I had no right to shoot. But
for sake of Luís, who was pouring new powder
in his rifle, I cared not even if I should
be accursed; and when the beast was very
close I sprang to one side and gave him the
ball, of an ounce weight, squarely upon the
side. But it could not enter him. Luís
jumped, too, and the brute passed between
us like a strong wind. In a moment he
turned and charged us again, and I am sure
I saw smoke come from his nose. As for
his eyes, they were pure fire. ‘Run for
yourself!’ cried Luís, and he made for the
tree, while I took the other way. Turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
a juniper, I ran for the edge of the cliff; but
just as I came there, there was a scream,
and looking across my shoulder, I saw the
deer making with his horns as one does
with his spade upon hard ground.</p>

<p>“After that I could go no more to our
camp, but came straightway to Abiquiu.
When they heard what had been, all the
town mourned—for Luís was well beloved.
But none were surprised, for they said:
‘Always we told him of the Venado Encantado,
but he would not believe. And now
it has come true. Poor headstrong Luís!’</p>

<p>“As for me, I sickened, and was much
time in bed. And always I saw the deer
leaping upon Luís and tearing him, until it
was not to be borne. When at last I was
cured, I could think only to kill the Witch
Deer, and avenge my poor <i lang="es">compañero</i>. I
asked of all the old men if there was how
to do it; but all said, ‘Beware, lest he trample
thee also!’ And Josefa prayed me to
think no more of it, for she would never
marry one who put himself against the
witches. I know not how, Don Carlos, for
I too feared, but Luís would not let me rest.</p>

<p>“Twice I went alone to the mesa, for
no one would companion me. <em>There</em> was
always the deer; but I kept under the
rocks, where he could not reach me, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
waited my turn. Once, when my aim was
true upon his heart, the rifle only snapped;
and when I went to prime with double care,
the flint was all in cracks, so that it would
not strike a spark. And again, when I shot
him between the very eyes, from near, it
did him nothing. So I saw it was useless.</p>

<p>“From then all went ill. Even the wild
turkeys had no fear of me, for I could shoot
nothing. And in Abiquiu I was mocked,
for the young men had been jealous that
formerly I had killed more game than any,
and now they taunted me for ‘the starved
hunter.’</p>

<p>“At the last I thought me of one who
lived in the cañon of Juan Tafoya—a witch,
they say, very wise in such things—and to
him I went. When he had heard my story,
he said: ‘But, man! knowest thou not that
this is the Venado Encantado? How dost
thou think to kill him? For he has in his
horns a stone of great power, having the
which he cannot be harmed. There is only
one way in which it could be done, and that
is to shoot him when he sees thee not. But
that, even the best hunter cannot do, for
the animal is very wise and of sharp sight.
Only having an invisible stone could one
do it.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘And have other deer this stone?’ I
asked; and he replied: ‘There are some,
for this is not the only Witch Deer. But
none of them canst thou kill if they see
thee.’</p>

<p>“After that they saw me little in Abiquiu,
for I was always hunting. For many
months I pursued the trail of every buck
deer, killing many. And at last, shooting
from ambush one that passed me unsuspecting,
I found in the first fork of its
horns a stone like this, but not the half of it
in size. This I proved in many ways, and
clear it was that now my luck had changed.</p>

<p>“Being satisfied of this, then, I loaded my
rifle with great pains, and went one evening
in search of the Venado Encantado. Coming
to the mesa by night, I camped among
the rocks, without a fire, and in the morning,
before the sun, climbed up without a little
noise. In my pouch was the stone, and my
rifle was well ready. When I came through
the cleft at the top, there stood the deer,
looking straight at me, not twenty yards
distant, and I threw my rifle to my shoulder,
giving myself up for lost. But he moved
not, and watching him, I perceived that he
did not see me at all—the which is proof
that the stone makes one to be invisible.
At this I took heart, and with a true aim on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
his throat, fired. He leaped <em>thus</em> high in
the air and fell dead; and coming to him, I
found that the ball had broken his neck.</p>

<p>“His meat I did not touch, for besides
being accursed, he had killed my Luís, whose
bones I brought away to Christian ground
in Abiquiu. But in the first fork of the
horns, which were taller than my head, I
found this stone which you see. Since I
have that, I kill whatsoever deer with ease,
because they cannot see me. What think
you, then?”</p>

<p>We sat for a few moments silent, watching
the flames that licked and twisted about
the cedar sticks in the fireplace. Anastácio
was voiceless, with an awe too strong even
for his boyish excitement; and as for me,
the story of Luís’s death had brought back
some vivid and uncanny memories. But
Don José, who really cared enough for me to
wish to lead me out of the darkness of error,
followed the matter up.</p>

<p>“Do you not see, Don Carlos, that there
<em>are</em> Witch Deer? For look at his fierceness,
and that he could not be hurt until I had a
charm-stone like his own. And you know
that I tell you truth.”</p>

<p>“Yes, old fellow, I know you tell me the
truth as you see it. But it is nothing
strange for a buck to be <i lang="es">bravo</i> in the fall—<em>that</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
I myself have suffered by. And I
fancy you <em>could</em> have killed him before, if
you had not felt so sure that you couldn’t.”
Then I was rather ashamed to have said
even so much, and as gently as it could be
said, for I do not admire the always-superior
person. But the old man understood, and
was not offended; only he shook his head
with real sadness, and said:</p>

<p>“Ah, that way was Luís. God keep you
from being taught as he was!”</p>

</div>

<p>The great water-wheel was trundling
as fast as ever the white impulse from
the old stone aqueduct could kick it along.
The wheel, indeed, grumbled at so much
hard work; but the water only laughed and
danced as the big iron jaws of the <i lang="es">trapiche</i><a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
chewed up the yellow culms of sugar cane
and spat to one side the useless pith, while
the sweet, dark sap crept sluggishly down
the iron conduit toward the sugar-house.
In front was a very mountain of cane
brought from the fields by bullock carts;
and half a dozen sinewy negroes were feeding
it, an armful at a time, between the rolls
of the mill. Behind it others with wooden
forks were spreading the crushed cane to
dry for a day, after which it would be used
as fuel to boil its own plundered juice. Off
beyond the sugar building gleamed the
white Moorish walls of the tile-roofed chapel
and manor house, built three hundred years
ago, when Peru was the richest crown jewel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
of Spain. Everywhere else stretched the
great fields of cane—to the very foot of the
sandhills of the encroaching desert, to the
very rim of the blue Pacific. What an immensity
of sugar it all meant!</p>

<p>The same thought struck the grizzled
<i lang="es">administrador</i><a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> this morning as he stood on
a pier of the aqueduct—just where its
stream pounced upon the lazy wheel—and
swept the scene with those watchful old
eyes. “Of a truth,” he was saying to himself,
“the world must be very large, as
they say, and many must eat nothing else,
for here we make every day forty thousand
pounds of sugar, three hundred days of
the year, and there are many other sugar
haciendas in Peru, though maybe none so
big as Villa. Truly, I know not where it all
goes. <i lang="es">Hola!</i> Always that fellow!” and,
springing to the ground as lightly as a boy,
in two bounds he was at the mill.</p>

<p>There four of the negro laborers were in
sudden struggle with a newcomer from the
quarters—a huge black fellow, whose brutish
face was now distorted by drunken
rage. He was naked to the waist, and his
dark hide bulged with tremendous muscles,
as he swayed his four grapplers to and fro,
trying to free his right hand, which clasped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
a heavy <i lang="es">machete</i>. This murderous combination
of sword and cleaver, which lopped
the stubborn cane at a blow, had found
worse employment now, for a red stain ran
down its broad blade, and on the ground lay
a man clenching a stump of arm. Old
Melito paused for no questions, but, plucking
up a heavy bar of <i lang="es">algarroba</i>, smote so
strongly upon the desperado’s woolly pate
that the ironwood broke. The black giant
reeled and fell, and one of the men wrenched
away the <i lang="es">machete</i> and flung it into the pool
below the wheel.</p>

<p>“He came very drunk, and only because
Roque brushed against him with an armful
of cane he wanted to kill him,” said the men
as they knotted their grimy handkerchiefs
upon the wrists and ankles of the stunned
black.</p>

<p>“You did well to hold him,” replied the
<i lang="es">admimistrador</i>. “Bring now the irons and
we will put him in the <i lang="es">calaboz</i> till to-morrow.
Then he shall go to Lima to the
prison, for we can have no fighting here,
nor men of trouble.”</p>

<p>A slender, big-eyed Spanish boy coming
out a few moments later from the great
castle arch of the manor house saw four
peons lugging away between them the long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
bulk of the prisoner, and stopped to ask
the trouble.</p>

<p>“Ah! That bad Coco. That he may
never come back from Lima,” said the
young Spaniard earnestly. “He is a terror
to all, and now I fear he will kill Don Melito,
for Coco never forgets. I shall ask my
father to see the prefect, that they keep
him away. And the sugar?”</p>

<p>Felipe never tired of following all the
processes with a grave air, as if it all rested
upon his small shoulders. A boy who never
felt that he was “helping”—if such a very
helpless boy ever existed—has lost one of
the best things in all boyhood, and Felipe
could not have understood such a boy at all.
He went on now and joined Don Melito,
and the two stood together watching the
vat with professional eyes while two negroes
plied their plashing hoes. It was very
hot work even to watch it, but a good <i lang="es">administrador</i>
would never trust this to the laborers.</p>

<p>“Now you watch it a little,” said Don
Melito suddenly, with roguish gravity,
looking at the boy’s preoccupied face. “As
for me, I must see how are the <i lang="es">pailas</i>,” and
he climbed the steps to the platform where
the caldrons were hissing with their new
supply of sap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>Felipe, thus left alone with the heaviest
responsibility he had ever borne, knit his
smooth brows very hard and peered into
the vat as if the fate of nations hung on
his eyes. For the first time he began to
doubt them. He wondered if it were not
worked enough—if he had not better stop
the hoes and get the molders to work. If
only Don Melito would come back and
decide for him!</p>

<p>But Don Melito was not here, and there
were no signs of his coming. Perhaps he
was leaving Felipe to find out the difference
between knowing how some one else
does a thing and how to do it one’s self.
The boy fidgeted up and down and looked
at the vat first from one end and then from
the other, and grew more doubtful the more
he looked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, and I don’t <em>know</em>,” he
cried to himself. “But sure it is that I
must do something, for he left me in charge
and perhaps is busy with other matters,
thinking I would not let it be spoiled. Put
it in the molds!”</p>

<p>The men leaned their candied hoes against
the wall. The molders began ladling their
buckets full, and, in turn, filling the shallow
molds. The color there darkened again as
sudden crystallization set in; but Felipe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
felt a great load lifted off his shoulders.
He was very sure now that it was a good
color—not a hint of the hateful underdone
black, but a soft, rich brown, shading to
gold at the thin edges.</p>

<p>Now he was free—the laborers could
attend to the rest, as usual—and he would
go and hunt for Don Melito. He ran up the
steps and along the platform—and half
way stopped short, as if he had run against
a wall.</p>

<p>The rusty irons should never have been
trusted with that giant’s strength! They
might do for common men, but for Coco—as
soon as consciousness came back to him,
and with it the old rage, he had snapped
them, and, wrenching out the iron bars
from the window of the <i lang="es">calaboz</i>, had come
for his revenge. Even now he was shaking
his wrists, one still hooped with the iron
band, before the old <i lang="es">administrador’s</i> face,
and hissing: “You! <em>You</em> did me this! And
now I will boil you!”</p>

<p>Don Melito stood still and gray as a stone,
looking up into Coco’s eyes. His hat was in
his hand on account of the heat; but now he
put it on as if scorning to stand uncovered
before the fellow—put it steadily upon the
curling gray hair that reached barely to the
level of those great naked chest muscles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>“I did strike you down and ordered you
to be ironed, Coco,” he said quietly, “and I
would do so again. Now I am going to send
you to Lima. There is no place at Villa for
people like you.”</p>

<p>But Coco leaped upon him like the black
jaguar, and clutched him with those long,
knotted arms. Melito was sinewy and lithe
as a cat, but he was no match for this huge
foe. He fought for life, but Coco with the
equal desperation of hate. Struggle as he
would, he was borne back and back until his
legs cringed from the glow of the <i lang="es">paila</i>.
At this he made so wild a lunge that it bore
them back a few feet; but it was only for a
moment. Inch by inch the negro urged him
toward that bubbling roar which seemed to
drown all other sounds. And even now,
with a wild chuckle, the giant doubled him
backward against the edge of the <i lang="es">paila</i>,
with a black, resistless palm under his chin.</p>

<p>Only an instant had Felipe stopped,
frozen, at sight of Coco; in another he had
sprung to the rail, shrieking to the men below:
“Juan! Sancho! Quico! Come!” And
then, rushing at the struggle, he flung himself
as ferociously upon Coco as Coco had
attacked Don Melito. But it seemed as if
he were back in some dreadful dream. He
hammered with futile fists upon that bare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
and mighty back, and caught a fierce hold
about one of those gnarled legs and tugged
to trip it, and kicked it with crazy feet. But
it was all with the nightmare sense that he
was doing nothing by all his efforts. Indeed,
it is half doubtful if the infuriated Coco
knew at all of this attack in the rear. What
to him were the peckings of a twelve-year-old
boy?</p>

<p>Would the men never come? Felipe redoubled
his kicks and blows, but with a
sickening fear. Don Melito was weakening—already
his head was thrust back over
the steam of the <i lang="es">paila</i>. Only for his arms
locked about the giant’s waist, he would go
in. And now Coco’s huge hand came behind
him and wrenched at the old man’s slender
ones, tearing open finger by finger resistlessly.
In another moment it would be too
late to think.</p>

<p>Aha, Mr. Coco! The boy sprang to the
second <i lang="es">paila</i> and snatched the long-handled
skimmer that leaned against it, and, dipping
it full from the caldron, flung the
molten sugar squarely upon Coco’s back.
Howling, the negro whirled about, dropping
the half-senseless <i lang="es">administrador</i> from him,
and sprang at Felipe. But the boy stood
stiff and very white, holding the ladle back
aloft. “This time in the eyes!” he cried,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
hoarsely. “If you touch Don Melito again,
or me, I will throw it in your face!”</p>

<p>Even Coco hesitated at this. He was not
too drunk with rage to know what boiling
sugar meant. Plainly, this little fool had the
advantage. He must be tricked—and then——.
But just then a wan smile flitted across
Felipe’s face, and, as Coco half turned his
head to see what pleasing thing could be behind
him, he got a glimpse of Pancho, the
horse-breaker, and something dark and
wavy in the air. He ducked forward, but
a rope settled upon his broad shoulders,
tightening like iron, and he was jerked
backward to the ground, and a dozen men
were upon him.</p>

<p>Coco made no more trouble on the
hacienda of Villa. At Lima he found the
prompt justice which sometimes happens
in Peru. Don Melito was in bed several
days, for he had been roughly handled in
body and in nerves. The first day on which
he could sit up a little, Felipe brought him
a cake of <i lang="es">chancaca</i>.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said the old man, laying
it on the coverlet. Sugar was an old story
to him.</p>

<p>“But you must taste this, my <i lang="es">administrador</i>,
and see if it is all right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is good,” answered Melito, munching
submissively. And then, with a sudden
light: “It is <em>very</em> good—as good as I could
have made myself. Quite right. And I
think you sent it to the molds at just the
right time!”</p>

<h4>I.</h4>

<p>“<i lang="es">Hupa mula! Que família!</i>”</p>

<p>The command was right enough,
for the beast barely moved, and any one who
ever had to do with mules may very likely
have cried out, with Andrés, “What a
family!” But no one but Andrés, I am sure,
would have said it here. By the time you
get up to 16,000 feet in the Andes, if you
are not dead altogether, you certainly have
no breath to spare—not even so much as to
say, “This mouth is mine.” As for exhorting
a pack-mule to “get up” or trying to
make it ashamed of its blood relations, why,
you couldn’t if you would. If some one
were to stand at the head of the pass offering
you a dollar a word for remarks, the
chances are a hundred to one that you would
find yourself without either the ambition or
the lungs to earn a nickel. It is a very
strange thing, as well as a very frightful
one, how these great altitudes clutch you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
by the windpipe, and turn your heart’s
strong beat to the last flutter of a wounded
bird, and fill your eyes with strange red
threads and your ears with a dull tap! tap!
tap! so that you can count your pulse simply
by listening. Worse still, how there seems
to have been turned somewhere a sly faucet
which has let the last drop of strength drip
away before you knew it. But very lucky
indeed are you if that is all. Many more
than escape with these unpleasant symptoms
have worse. There is a horrible
nausea, as much beyond seasickness as
that is beyond a plain stomach-ache, and
nearly every one gets it above a certain
height. Then come sudden hemorrhages
from nose, mouth, ears, eyes, finger-tips,
and so on to the last. These symptoms
and any of them mean, “Get down stairs
instanter.” If you cannot get down fast
enough you will be carried down—too late
to do you any good. I have seen great,
powerful men fall there as an ox falls when
the ax is laid to its head, and never rise
again nor again be conscious. At less elevations
I have seen robust men go dead in
twenty-four hours with no disease on earth
but the altitude. Only recently an acquaintance
of mine visiting a town but 12,500 feet
above the sea went to bed in perfect health<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
and—“woke up dead in the morning,” as a
Celtic mutual friend related in all sincerity.</p>

<p>Still, the only certain thing about it is
that if you go high enough you will pay the
penalty; but no one can tell you how high
that is, nor can you yourself learn finally,
even by experiment. You may start out
with a party from one of the inland towns
of Peru, say at an elevation of 7,000 to 8,000
feet—and even there many are greatly
affected by the altitude. One of the party,
and perhaps the most robust looking, may
become so dangerously sick at 10,000 feet
that he will have to be sent back at once.
The rest may go on safely to 12,000 feet,
and there another succumb, and so on.
And you may (though it is very unlikely)
toil on even up to 17,000 or 18,000 feet without
serious symptoms, and then a few days
later be so terribly affected at 10,000 feet
that only the most rapid removal to lower
levels will save your life. Myself, I have
never felt the mountain sickness. But then,
my constitution is a most extraordinarily
pig-headed one, which seems to butt against
almost any wall with impunity. I have
climbed and worked hard at considerably
over 19,000 feet, and for a long time lived
from 12,000 to 15,000 feet above the sea, and
never felt anything worse than room for an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
extra pair of lungs, there where is really
precious little air to breathe. But warning
was all around, so that I never felt quite
sure my turn would not come next.</p>

<p>There is much in habit, of course. You
all remember the Irishman’s horse which
learned to live on shavings—though unfortunately
it died just as it was becoming
accustomed to this economical diet.
And lungs, too, can get used to living on
such shavings as the upper air—that is, if
there are lungs enough and you give them
long enough. Many die in the learning, but
in centuries a type is fixed. So with Andrés.
His fathers for a thousand years had
breathed no heavier air than that of the
great Bolivian plateau. He had been born
on one of the “little hills” beside Lake
Titi-caca, and brought up there. Leadville
is the highest considerable town in North
America, and it is too elevated for a great
many people; but Andrés had never in his
life got so low as 11,000 feet. If he were
suddenly set down in New York his lungs
would be almost as much embarrassed
as would yours if you were so suddenly
snatched up to his skyward home. He
might almost call for an ax to break that
thick air up into breathing chunks! And
you, sitting with bloodshot eyes and open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
mouth, would be wondering what skim-milk
atmosphere was this, that in ten minutes’
gasping you could not get as fair a fill
to your lungs as you now get with every
breath you draw.</p>

<p>The mule was a well-seasoned mule, born
in Puno and never any nearer sea level than
that 12,500-foot town. True, it was now
some 4,000 feet nearer the sky, and barely
crawling up the pass. At every half-dozen
or dozen paces it paused to groan despairingly,
panting full five minutes before it
could go another step. But that was a good
mule. If you wished to see what an ordinary
mule did in the pass, you had only to
look at either side of the trail almost anywhere.
There were hundreds of bleached
skeletons lying just where they had fallen,
but white as the snows upon the peaks above.
Here and there were even the bones of the
llama<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>—the highest-dwelling quadruped on
earth. As for horses, their usefulness
ceases long before reaching such altitudes
as that of the Quimca-chata. I have seen
people who had an air of feeling that the
mule ought always to be begging pardon
for being alive, and that nature was in
pretty small business when she made him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
But that, of course, is a notion of very uninformed
folk. In fact, as all know who have
stirred out a little, the mule is the most
broadly useful animal in the service of man.
The horse can run faster, the elephant
carry heavier loads, the llama climb higher
above the clouds; but no other beast can
carry so much so far, so fast, so low and so
high as this unpretentious and maligned
big-ears; and wherever civilized man has
had to conquer the wilderness this has been
his best friend.</p>

<p>Something of this was in the thought of
the traveler sprawled beside the <i lang="es">apacheta</i>
at the head of the pass—watching now the
gasping saddle-mule near him, and now
the rest of his small caravan as it crept
upward. He was breathing with open
mouth, but otherwise showed no traces of
the hour’s climb since he left Andrés and
the pack-beast, and tramped on, driving
his own mule ahead rather than ride the
distressed beast.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he was saying (but to himself,
which called for no expenditure of breath),
“old Tom Moore, Crook’s chief packer, was
right when he used to say, ‘God made mules
a-purpose!’ How they have been the right
hand of the pioneer in both Americas. <i lang="es">Bien</i>,
Andrés—so you got him up at last.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>Andrés took off his frowsy hat, leaving
upon his head the long-peaked knit cap of
vicuña<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> wool, removed from his mouth the
quid of coca leaves he had been chewing,
and flung the wad against the rough, upright
stone, which was already pimpled all
over with similar offerings. No mountain
Indian of Bolivia would any more think
of passing such a monument at the crest of
a pass without making this sacrifice than
you would think of going into church with
your hat on.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Si, viracocha</i>,” he answered, with a slow,
good-natured smile; and went on in his
stumbling mixture of Spanish and Aymará.
“You ought to bite the coca, <i lang="es">ps, viracocha</i>,
that the <i lang="es">sorojchi</i> catch you not. For so do
we of the mountains, and by it we get our
strength. Take”—and he drew from his
left-hand pouch a pinch of the dried leaves
and a bit of lime.</p>

<p>The American shook his head, with a
smile, as much as to say: “Thanks, but I
need it not.” Then he rose, with a significant
glance at the clouds, and made a gesture
of haste, pointing to the trail which
from their feet dipped far downward to the
east.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>Andrés cinched up the sagging <i lang="es">chipas</i> on
the pack-mule, setting his bare foot against
its ribs and hauling at the hair rope with
main strength. The traveler likewise
tightened his saddle-girth and swung up.
Half an hour more, and they were some
miles down the slope, descending at a gait
which was decidedly smart compared with
the snail’s pace of the last few hours.
Through gaps in the foothills ahead came
now and then wondrous outlooks across the
upper Bolivian plateau. Off to the left was
the glorious blue of Titi-caca, highest great
lake in the world; behind it, and stretching
far to the right, the still more glorious
white of the great Andes of Bolivia.</p>

<p>“There, <em>mps</em>, is Mururata, the Beheaded,”
said the arriero, pointing to a flat-topped
peak far lower than the rest, but still tall
enough to wear eternal snow. “The gods
cut off its head long ago, to punish pride,
and set it over yonder, where you will soon
see it smoke—for now it is a fire mountain.”
Andrés trotted along, pointing,
chattering, smiling, as if breath were quite
the cheapest thing on earth.</p>

<p>Just then the traveler found a little, too—but
not for the lost head of Mururata. He
was staring across a saddle in the hills with
very much such a face of incredulity and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
bewilderment as one might wear at sight
of a ghost.</p>

<p>“Seest thou?” he demanded of the arriero.
“Confuse me, but I thought there
was no such thing as a wheel in the country,
except the Chililaya stage.”</p>

<p>“Oh, <i lang="es">si, viracocha</i>—in La Paz are five
or six carriages! And yonder will be the
Jaúregui going to their <i lang="es">chacra</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>A top buggy of most ancient pattern was
creeping up around the turn at the heels of
four tired mules. In a few moments the
travelers were not far apart; and now Andrés’s
employer broke out afresh, but in a
lower tone:</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Oyez!</i> But where is the feast to which
these <i lang="es">maromeros</i> go?”</p>

<p>They did look clown-like enough, to be
sure. The driver was clearly an Aymará
Indian, and showed nothing more peculiar
than the quaint garb of his people. But at
his left sat two tall and surprising figures
in long linen dusters and white peaked
caps. The latter were shaped something
like fools’ caps; but instead of ending at
the ears came down upon the shoulders,
over the whole head. Eye and mouth holes
and a woven nose gave them a finish as
uncanny as it was strange.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Á Diós, caballero!</i>” cried a muffled voice
in clearly well-bred Spanish; and the Indian
driver pulled the willing mules to a halt.
One of the masks leaned from the carriage,
and from behind the white yarn a pair of
keen, black eyes stared first at the pack-mule
and then at the American.</p>

<p>“Pardon the molesting, but you carry a
machine of the photograph, is it not?”</p>

<p>The tripod stretching along the pack-beast
from ears to tail, and the square,
leather boxes in the <i lang="es">chipas</i> were clear
enough, and the traveler replied politely:</p>

<p>“As you see, sir.”</p>

<p>“Good! And how much is worth a picture?
Come, we will occupy you.”</p>

<p>“Infinite thanks, cavaliers, but I do not
sell. And pardon, for I am in haste.”</p>

<p>“How not?” There was an incredulous
flash in the ambushed eyes, and the voice
had lost the edge of its courtesy. “We
have money in hand, and we wish to take
out our pictures.”</p>

<p>“I lament it, sirs; but you ask the impossible.
The government of Bolivia has
entered my materials free of duty, seeing
that I come on a scientific mission; and in
return, that your native artists shall not
have whereof to complain, I am pledged to
sell no pictures. It often pains me, knowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
how one feels for a picture here where
artists are few. But in any event, I make
<i lang="es">vistas</i> only for the one purpose, and need all
the plates we brought.”</p>

<p>The maskers evidently did not credit any
such absurd story. The gringo—he was
a gringo, of course, in spite of his comfortable
Spanish—<i lang="es">pues</i>, he knew them for rich
and was holding off for a big offer.</p>

<p>“Well, we will give fifty <i lang="es">bolivianos</i>.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Get
in and we will carry you to the <i lang="es">chacra</i>.
There is your home. You shall stay so
much as you will; and there is much hunting
and such views of Illimani as you have
not seen. Also, there are strange monuments
of the ancients. Eh? Then one
hundred <i lang="es">bolivianos</i>!”</p>

<p>“I give you the most expressive thanks,
gentlemen, and would willingly see your
<i lang="es">chacra</i>. But I am bound for Tiahuanaco.
And, in any event, you must know that I
talk not lumber, but truth. I cannot make
your pictures.”</p>

<p>“Listen, then,” muttered the Bolivian
angrily, turning to his fellow-mask, “how
hard-headed are these gringos! Come,”
addressing the traveler again, “you are
too dear. But we will say two hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
<i lang="es">bolivianos</i>,” and he held up a huge roll of
small red bank bills.</p>

<p>By now there was a considerable wrinkle
in the traveler’s brow. “God give you
good evening, cavaliers,” he said, curtly.
“I am of one yes and one no. If you want
<i lang="es">retratos</i> I know no place nearer than La Paz
where you can get them. <i lang="es">Adios.</i>”</p>

<p>He set spurs to his mule and rode off
down hill. The two maskers looked blankly
at one another a moment, and then their
mules began to plod up the slope amid a
volley of Spanish expletives. Andrés had
prodded the pack-beast to a lurching trot,
and ran easily at its heels.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Mps, viracocha</i>,” he said, in a loud
whisper, taking off his hat again as he drew
alongside the traveler. “But those are the
Jaúregui, and it would be better to please
them. They are most powerful, and very
hard-headed, too.”</p>

<p>“Then let them butt against a harder
head. I can’t—<i lang="es">hola!</i> Vicuñas, no?”</p>

<p>The frown had smoothed out, and he was
snatching the rifle from its holster strapped
along the saddle. Away over on an opposite
slope a little brown cloud was drifting.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Si!</i> But they go!” cried Andrés.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>The cloud was, indeed, breaking up in a
score of wee brown dots that scudded like
so many shadows.</p>

<p>“Too far! And I wanted some pelts for
a little girl I know. To try, anyhow!” The
traveler jerked the rifle to his shoulder and
fired. “Nothing,” he sighed. “Of course
not—it was a shot thrown away.” But
Andrés cried: “You touched! See yonder,
how he makes lame!”</p>

<p>“Your eyes for it—mine don’t reach so
far. But one does look to have fallen behind.
Too bad! Now it is to run him down—a
man even in a hurry can’t leave the poor
wounded brute to be gouged piecemeal by
the condors. Go on thy best with the pack-beast,
Andrés, and I’ll catch thee at the
<i lang="es">tambo</i>, or sooner.”</p>

<p>The arriero ambled on, with now and then
a reminding cudgel to his charge. A funny
man, this—no? But then, no doubt all
gringos were a little wrong in the head.
To refuse two hundred <i lang="es">bolivianos</i> for a picture,
and then go ramping off to kill a
wounded vicuña! Smart are the Yanquis,
yes—but of reason, not much. As if the
condors were to blame if they could catch
a thing injured! And it can be that they
will have mule as well as vicuña for supper.
The <i lang="es">viracocha</i> evidently forgets that he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
on the ground of the mountain sickness.
Pity if it should catch him—since he is
very good, unbrained though he be.</p>

<p>But at a turn in the trail Andrés found
other matters to be thought of than the
general follies and occasional virtues of the
Yanquis. Other ears than his had heard
the rifle, and other eyes noted the traveler’s
tangent; and now the young Indian gave a
start very like one of fear at the rattle of
wheels behind him and an imperious call of
“<i lang="es">Alto!</i>”</p>

<h4>II.</h4>

<p>Andrés glanced over his shoulder and
faced about in his tracks. It was only for
an instant that he thought of running. He
might make a break down the rough hillside,
where the carriage could not follow,
yes. But the pack-mule, sagging under
those boxes, of which the <i lang="es">viracocha</i> was so
tender! The boy’s thick lips drew tight
across his large, white teeth. He would
stay. The instant he ceased to beset its
heels the fagged beast stopped too, and
there they stood like two shabby statues,
while the carriage drew alongside.</p>

<p>“So the gringo hunts, eh?” spoke one
of the maskers, briskly, stepping down
from the buggy. “But he is very high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
priced, it seems—as much as unamiable.
Come, tell us how much he does get—for
in truth I thought we offered enough.”</p>

<p>“Who knows, your excellency?” stammered
Andrés. “It is a month that I am
with him as arriero, and until now he pictures
only the monuments. And even of
those I have not yet seen the <i lang="es">retratos</i>, for
he says he is to finish them when we shall
reach La Paz. Of people he always refuses—as
your excellency saw. Except that
once, in Copacabana, he pictured an ancient
beggar at the gate, taking no money.”</p>

<p>“Ay, but these gringos are many sorts of
fools—and this one <em>all</em> sorts. Come, then,
these <i lang="es">vistas</i> he has made, they will be in the
<i lang="es">chipas</i>. To see them!”</p>

<p>The speaker’s air and tone were plainly
those of one who has no dream of not being
obeyed, and he fairly stiffened with astonishment
when the arriero, rather pale and
very much embarrassed, stammered:</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">P-pero</i>, excellency, I—I—cannot!”</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Mira!</i> Another who ‘cannot!’ It is
contagious, then, this ‘<i lang="es">no puedo!</i>’ <i lang="es">Oyez!</i>”
and now the command was sharp and stern,
“Open me those boxes!”</p>

<p>Andrés backed off a step. His brown
cheeks were unmistakably gray, and his
voice faltered as he replied, humbly, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
stolidly: “Do not shame me, Excellency.
This <i lang="es">viracocha</i> hires me, treating me
kindly. For arriero, yes—but even more,
he has me to guard the machine when he is
not beside it. For so many wish to peep
in, and he has things in little flat boxes
which he opens only at night in a room
without candles, and not even smoking his
<i lang="es">cigarro</i>. He says that to let in a so-little
of light would destroy all. For that I am
promised, that no one shall open them nor
touch them. Do not ask me, then, excellency.”</p>

<p>“<em>Ask</em> thee, cannibal! A Jaúregui asking
thee? <i lang="es">Vaya!</i> I <em>order</em> thee. And between
winks, too, lest thou taste the quirt!” He
snatched from his driver the short, leaden-butted
bull whip.</p>

<p>Andrés backed away still farther, till he
ran up against the pack of his dejected
mule, which stood as if petrified there.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">No puedo, taita!</i>” he repeated, with an
appealing glance. Then, as the man
reached forth to pluck the knot of the cinch
rope, Andrés extended his arm as a barrier,
crying, “<i>Haniwa!</i> Your excellency
must not!”</p>

<p>At this actual obstruction the personage
in the white hood clearly lost an already
ruffled temper. He drew the quirt whistling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
around those sturdy, bare calves, and
a blue welt stood up there. Another cut,
and another. The stolid face changed little,
but the legs shifted uneasily.</p>

<p>“<i>Haniwa</i>, is it?” The ambushed eyes
seemed fairly outside the mask now, so
angrily they shone. “Then we will see!
To beat a little more manners into that
thick skull.” He shifted the quirt in his
hand, clubbing the loaded end over Andrés’s
head. The arriero flung up his
hands. He was a sinewy young man, very
probably much more powerful than his tall
assailant. Nor was he thinking of the odds
of those two more in the carriage. It was
tradition, not cowardice, that stayed his
hands—how could this arriero and son of
arrieros think to strike a don? For he was
born and bred in a country where there is
still such a thing as respect—sometimes
misapplied, as now; but broadly so honorable
that I wish some reciprocity treaty
might enable us to import some of it for
northern use.</p>

<p>The leaden butt fell across his guard,
and one hand dropped to his side. The
other he drew before his eyes.</p>

<p>“Come! Will thou open, or shall I crack
that foolish squash-head?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>Andrés did not move. “<i>Haniwa!</i>” he
muttered in the same slow, stupid way,
shutting his eyes as the club rose again.
But just then a voice called from the
carriage:</p>

<p>“To what use, brother? They are no
more than clods. Beat one to death, and
you shall not change him. Let Pepe tie
him and then we can verify the boxes.”</p>

<p>The one with the quirt hesitated a moment.
His blood was hot, and the brute in
him ached to beat away at this maddening
stupid. His hand dropped reluctantly, and
he growled:</p>

<p>“As thou wilt. Rope him then, Pepe.”</p>

<p>But if the arriero had stood dumb under
the lash of his superior, it was another page
in the almanac when a brown fellow of his
own blood and station caught him by the
arms and started to pass a reata around
him. Andrés doubled forward at the waist,
clumsily but resistlessly. His tousled head
struck Pepe on the mouth, and that too-ready
henchman rolled heavily in the road.
Andrés sprang upon him and flung fistfuls
of dust in his face, shaking him as a terrier
does a rat.</p>

<p>“Pig! Who lent thee a candle in this
funeral? Thy master I could not fight.
But thou, barbarian——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Socorro!</i>” bawled Pepe, quite helpless
in the clutch of his exasperated rider.
“Take him off!”</p>

<p>“I’ll take him off!” growled the master,
and he ran forward, swinging the club about
his head. Woe is me for thy skull, Andresito,
if that ounce of lead befall it squarely
from behind!</p>

<h4>III.</h4>

<p>When the “gringo” and his laboring
mule pitched down the side of a very
considerable <i lang="es">barranca</i>, their quarry was
plainly visible four or five hundred yards
up the opposite hill. The rest of the flock
had long ago disappeared, and by now was
miles away—for they run almost like antelope,
these airy beauties of the Andes, the
tiniest camels in the world, and the only
graceful ones. But when mule and rider
struggled up the farther bank, the wounded
vicuña was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>“Plague! But I must not kill <em>thee</em>, in
trying to be merciful to him,” muttered the
rider, and he sprang to the ground. It was
high time. The mule stood gasping in his
tracks, head down, chin hanging and knees
quaking violently. The traveler looked up
and down him, remorsefully but critically.</p>

<p>“With a rest, thou’rt all right. But I
ought to beg thy pardon for giving thee a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
fool for a rider! Now, my legs for it—and
rest thou here.”</p>

<p>The involuntary object of all this trouble
was certainly inconsiderate. Having been
so foolish as to go and get wounded, he
should have waited at least for the Samaritan
to come up and give him the blow of
mercy. But, instead, he hobbled bleating
on in pursuit of his fellows, even long after
they had vanished. It was astonishing how
this delicate, fawn-like creature could run
so far with a broken leg, and his well-meaning
pursuer began to find it more than astonishing.
Plague take the little imbecile—he
was bound to make it as hard as possible
to do him a good turn! It is odd how
our minds can contradict themselves—how
we sometimes start out on a thoroughly
praiseworthy errand, and fall into very unamiable
moods by the way.</p>

<p>The pursuer was by now decidedly
angry—which is a very unwise luxury to
be indulged in, at least among the Andes.
His temper was by no means calculated to
soothe the stampeding gallop of his heart;
and to see him gasping up yonder <i lang="es">cumbre</i>,
with a purpling face and protruding tongue,
and a scowl on his brow, probably no stranger
would have dreamed that he was really
on a generous errand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>“Belike the condors will have to have
thee!” he groaned inwardly—since not for
his life, now, could he have articulated the
words: “I’m done up! This one more
ridge and it must end.”</p>

<p>But as he reached the top of that last
ridge, there was a tremendous <em>swoosh</em> of
wings past him, and then, from the hollow
beyond, a scream almost human in its
agony. At that he plucked new vigor, and
went racing down the slope in a surprising
spurt. The truth was that, once started,
he had no longer the strength to stop on
that stiff pitch, and must keep on till he
should fall or fetch up against some obstacle.
His sight was blurred, his head roaring,
his legs numb, and where his heart
should be, a strange, suffocating emptiness
seemed to have come—and still he spun on.
Then, in a reeling way, he swung the six-shooter
thrice, firing as fast as finger could
pull the trigger; in the same second, sprawling
headlong in a confusion of bleats and
silken fur and beating wings. A tremendous
blow from one of the latter cut his
scalp clear across the occiput. The revolver
blazed again, and, after a wild thrashing,
all was still.</p>

<p>It was some minutes before the hunter
sat up, gazing about him in a dazed way.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
The rest and the chilly air and the loss of
blood were beginning to counteract the
effects of his imprudent chase.</p>

<p>“Well! The next time I shoot before I
think, I won’t shoot!” he informed himself
without expense of breath, and with the
ghost of a smile. “Wonder I hadn’t killed
myself with such a race, up here. But if
you start, finish!” and he looked complacently
down at the little dead vicuña against
which he leaned; and not a rod away the
huge vulture sprawled upon its back, its
wings outstretched a full dozen feet, its feet
clenched in the empty air.</p>

<p>“He got only one swipe at thee, it seems.
It’s all right, so that I came in time to give
thee a more merciful death. So we won’t
grudge the breath it cost me. But the least
thanks thou canst give me is that precious
pelt.” Drawing his knife, the hunter soon
removed that very softest and most exquisite
of all furs. Then with an uneasy
glance at the clouds he turned away, walking
as briskly as his protesting lungs would
allow.</p>

<p>Good! There was the mule all right. It
had not budged a foot; and now, though still
in an attitude of utter dejection, was clearly
out of danger. Directly, master and mule
were jogging off toward the trail at a most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
doleful gait—which doubtless would have
been mended, if they could have seen
through the rounded hill just ahead. But
the hill was opaque, as hills and circumstances
ahead are so prone to be; and they
pottered along lazily, until, at a turn over
the ridge, the spurs went drumming such
an unexpected tattoo upon his echoing ribs
that the mule quite forgot himself, and went
pitching down the hill at a pace he had not
taken in a month.</p>

<h4>IV.</h4>

<p>Away down yonder, a superannuated
buggy and its team stood in the trail. A
few rods ahead of it, and just at the heels
of a wilted pack-mule, two men were scuffling
in the dust; and over them a hooded
figure was bringing down a heavy club.
At that instant the pack beast wakened
enough to turn his head interrogatively,
cocking one ear forward and the other back.
Even as he did so, his nigh hind leg could
be seen to gather itself and suddenly lunge
out behind. A long, linen-shrouded form,
white capped at one end, thereupon doubled
in half, and rose in the air and went whirling
like a boomerang. It fell a full rod
away and did not rise. Then a similar
figure sprang from the buggy and rushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
at the wrestlers; but midway went down all
at once in a loose heap, as if struck by a
bullet. No wonder the stranger up yonder
drummed with his heels, and jockeyed, and
whooped; and, finding his charger still too
slow, leaped from its back and came bounding
down the hillside like a loosened rock.</p>

<p>Andrés was sitting placidly astride his
prostrate foe, breathing rather hard, but
looking stupidly good-natured as ever. One
of his fingers was broken, and blood from a
gash on his forehead trickled down his
nose.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Mps, viracocha</i>,” he answered to the
breathless traveler’s glance of inquiry,
“the <i lang="es">caballeros</i> were set to see the inside of
your boxes, and because I refused they
went to beat me. But when this cannibal
here came upon me, then it was to fight.
The blows of a gentleman, yes—but not of
a <i lang="es">chuncho</i>.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> So I measured him, thus. And
when the gentleman went to crack me the
squash with his quirt, then did Big-Ears
here, forgetting respect to the powerful,
set heel to his stomach and lift him until
over yonder.”</p>

<p>“And this? I saw him fall as he ran at
you,” the <i lang="es">viracocha</i> mustered breath to say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>“He? <em>Mps</em>, but it will be the <i lang="es">sorojchi</i>—see
you not how the blood falls from his
mouth? And you see, <i lang="es">viracocha</i>, how
strong is the coca! Because I sacrificed at
the <i lang="es">apacheta</i>, as one should, to the spirits of
the high places, it has all come as the mouth
would ask. Without that, then, the gentlemen
would have left me here, of no more
use to your grace, and the magic boxes
would be emptied in the light.”</p>

<p class="tb">When night came down on the Quimca-chata,
a gusty snowstorm, with howling
intervals of hail, beset the pass. It roared
at the hills, it swooped down the cañons as
if in search of some living thing it might
turn to ice before morning. But inside the
low, dirty <i lang="es">tambo</i>, they only laughed at its
rage. The bald stone hut in a little nook
under the shoulder of a hill had neither
window nor chimney; and a heavy poncho
of llama hair was the temporary door. It
was a fair type of the <i lang="es">tambos</i> of the Andes—those
tenantless, cheerless wayside shelters
that save the traveler in those bleak
lands from perishing. On the sooty hearth
a faint blaze of <i lang="es">taqui</i> wavered, and the smoke
wandered out as best it could or made itself
at home in the bare room. Upon the rough
stone bench along the walls sat five men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
and in the farther corner six mules nosed
wistfully in a rubbish heap for casual
straws. Of the men two were Indians, and
both wore bandaged heads. The third
guest of this inn without a landlord appeared
to be an American, and he also had
a handkerchief bound about his skull. The
two others were handsome, swarthy men in
costly vicuña ponchos. They sat on linen
dusters, from the pockets of which peeped
the tasseled ends of two white caps.</p>

<p>One member of the party cast now and
then a sly glance at these. So, instead of
clowns going to some feast, these were two
wealthy Bolivians. And those astonishing
head masks which had so mystified him
were merely to save their faces from that
trying mountain air—so Andrés had informed
him, with an evident effort not to
pity his ignorance. And looking at those
coffee complexions he had serious work to
keep from smiling at the thought of trying
to keep them from sunburn.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Pues</i>, it is as well the <i lang="es">tambo</i> was near,
for none of us were in shape to go much
farther to-night, even forgetting the storm.
<i lang="es">Ea!</i> But how it howls, as if disappointed!”</p>

<p>It was the American who broke the silence,
though he spoke, of course, in Spanish—the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
only common possession of the five
tongues.</p>

<p>“You have reason, <i lang="es">caballero</i>,” answered
the taller of the two dons, courteously.
“And even more am I glad that we make
ourselves pardoned. Of a truth, we were
most ignorant that to open your cases would
spoil all; nor could we have thought to take
the liberty, but that we believed you a—a
seller baiting us for higher pay. But we
were well answered. Your so obstinate
arriero made me forget myself, and I give
you a <i lang="es">caballero’s</i> apology. But that mule—<i lang="es">ay
de mi!</i> I thought Illampu itself had
tumbled upon me!”</p>

<p>“Verily, señor! I saw it from the hill,
and it was so prettily done as I never could
have believed. Why, señor, he shut you at
the waist like a knife with a strong spring!”</p>

<p>The cavalier smiled a trifle weakly at the
description, but he said frankly:</p>

<p>“He did but justice. I have shame to
think how I lost a gentleman’s temper.
And so little more and I could have broken
your man’s head. But since you have the
fineness to hold no malice, it is well.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know curiosity and temper both.
Only that it is Andrés’s head and not mine.
But his need not be too sore—for you have
caused me to double his wages from to-day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
An arriero that will stand a broken head to
guard the <i lang="es">amo’s</i> load—well, I haven’t found
him very abundant in Bolivia, nor anywhere
else.”</p>

<p>“You have reason always. And—er—understood
that—<i lang="es">pues</i>, you know that Don
Juan de Jaúregui cannot say to an arriero,
‘pardon’! But in purity of truth, he is
faithful, and I would be glad to give him a
well paid position on the <i lang="es">chacra</i>.”</p>

<p>“Eh, Andrés? The cavalier offers justly.
What sayest thou?”</p>

<p>Andrés’s face beamed simply, and he
twisted his skull cap as he rose with a
clumsy bow.</p>

<p>“I shall be glad,” he stammered. “But
only if—until—when that the <i lang="es">viracocha</i>
shall have no more need of an arriero. For
while the magic boxes have to ride on the
ribs of a mule, it is safer that I be driver—since
the <i lang="es">viracocha</i> has shown me, and I
know how they must be treated. ‘Gently!
Gently! And for the life of you, let no light
come into them!’”</p>

<h3>Our Yellow Slave.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 50px;">
<img src="images/deco-chap.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The only metal in the world that is
yellow is the most precious of them
all—gold. Brass is not a metal, but an
alloy, a compound. And the color which
gold shares with the sun has a great deal
to do with its value. I do not suppose it
would be possible that we should ever have
come to love and admire any metal so much
as to choose it for our highest currency and
our ornaments, no matter how rare or ductile
it might be, if it were of a dark, dull,
gloomy color. The human eye never gets
too old to be pleased with very much the
same things which pleased it in childhood;
and no eye is insensible to that precious
yellow.</p>

<p>I like sometimes to think back to the first
man of all men that ever held that rock of
the sun in his savage hand, and to imagine
how he found it, and how it made his sharp
eyes twinkle, and how he wondered at its
weight, and pounded it with one smooth
rock upon another and found he could flatten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
it. All these things come by accident,
and gold was an accident that befell when
the world was very young. No doubt there
had been a great rain, that washed the
heavy lump from its nest in some gravelly
stream bank, and the prehistoric man, in
his tunic of skins, chanced that way and
found it. Mayhap it was the very rain of
the Flood itself, and the poor barbarian
who picked up the yellow nugget sank with
it still in his swarthy fist.</p>

<p>We do not even know the name of the
man who first discovered gold, nor where
he lived, nor when. But it was very, very
long ago. Before the time of Joseph and
the coat of many colors, gold had already
become not only a discovered fact, but a
part of the world. The early Egyptians
got their gold from Nubia, so very likely
the discovery was first made in Africa. At
all events, it dates back to the very childhood
of the race; and before Cadmus had
found those more important nuggets of the
alphabet, mankind had achieved the prettiest
plaything it ever found.</p>

<p>In the very first chapter of the first and
noblest of poems, Homer tells of the priest
who came with a golden ransom to the camp
of the Greeks before Troy, to buy his
daughter free; and the sunny metal figures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
everywhere in the oldest mythology we
know. You have all read—and I hope in
Hawthorne’s “Tanglewood Tales,” where
the story is more beautifully told than it
was ever elsewhere—of Jason and the Argonauts
and of how they sailed to find the
Golden Fleece. That was a fabulous ram-skin,
whose locks were of pure gold. No
wonder the deadly dragon in the dark
groves of the Colchian king guarded it so
jealously. Of course the myth is only a
poetic form—as stories generally assume
in the folk-lore of an undeveloped race—of
saying that Jason and his bold fellow-sailors
of the Argo sailed to the gold fields of
Asia, and found them. The mines whose
fabled richness tempted them to that adventurous
voyage in their overgrown row-boat
of fifty oars, were in the Caucasus
mountains, and produced a great deal of
the gold which was used by the ancients.
They were doubtless among the first gold
mines in the world, and their product gilded
the splendor of many of the first great
monarchs of history. As late as 1875 an
attempt was made by Europeans to work
these mines, but nothing came of it.</p>

<p>“Rich as Crœsus” has been for more than
two thousand years a proverb which is not
yet supplanted; and that last king of Lydia—and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
richest king of all time, according to
the ancient myths—got his wealth from
placer mines in the river Pactolus, whose
name has been as synonymous with gold
as Crœsus’s own. One of the strangest
and wisest of the folk-stories of ancient
Greece tells how that little river in Asia
Minor first gained its golden sands. Some
seven hundred years before Christ, there
was a king of Phrygia who had more gold
than Crœsus ever dreamed of—so much
gold that it made him the poorest man in the
world! It was King Midas, son of Gordius,
who earned this strange distinction. He
had done a favor to Dionysus, and the god
said gratefully: “Wish one wish, whatever
thou wilt, and I will grant it.” Now Midas
had already caught the most dangerous of
all “yellow fevers”—the fever for gold—and
he replied: “Then let it be that all
things which I shall touch shall be turned
into gold.”</p>

<p>Dionysus promptly granted this foolish
prayer; and Midas was very happy for a little
time. He picked up stones from the ground,
and instantly they changed to great lumps
of gold. His staff was gold, and his very
clothing became yellow and so heavy that
he could barely stagger under its weight.
This was very fine indeed! He touched the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
corner of his palace—and lo! the whole
building became a house of pure gold.
Splendid! He entered, and touched what
took his fancy; and furniture, and clothing,
and all, underwent the same magic change.
Better and better! “I’m the luckiest king
alive,” chuckled Midas, still looking about
for something new to transmute.</p>

<p>But even kings who have the golden
touch must sometimes eat, and presently
Midas grew hungry with so much wealth-making.
He clapped his hands, and the
servants spread the royal table. A touch
of the royal finger, and table and cloth and
dishes were yellow gold. This was something
like! The exhilarated king sat down
and broke a piece of bread—but as he
lifted it, it was strangely heavy, and he saw
that it, too, was of the precious metal! A
doubt ran through his foolish head whether
even the golden touch might not have its
drawbacks; but he was very hungry, and
did not wait to weigh the question. If his
fingers turned the bread to gold, he would
take something from a spoon—and he lifted
a ladle of broth to his mouth. But the instant
it touched his lips, the broth turned
to a great yellow button, which dropped
ringing back upon the golden board.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>The disquieted king rose and walked out
of the palace. At the door he met his fair-faced
little daughter, who held up a bright
flower to him. Midas laid his hand gently
upon her head, for he loved the child, foolish
as he was. And lo! his daughter stood motionless
before him—a pitiful little statue
of shining gold!</p>

<p>How much longer this accursed power
tormented the miserable monarch the myth
does not tell us; but he was cured at last by
bathing in the river Pactolus, and the washing
away of his magic power filled the sands
of the stream with golden grains.</p>

<p>The Midases are not dead yet—for the
one of ancient fable there are thousands to-day,
at whose very touch all turns to gold.
Their food does not become metal between
their lips—but often it might as well, for
all the joy they have of it. And the little
Phrygian princess was not the only child to
be changed and hardened forever by the
“Golden Touch.”</p>

<p>Gold figures largely through all the quaint
history-fables of the ancients; and history
itself is full of tales hardly less remarkable.
The early history of America was <em>made</em> by
gold—or rather, by golden hopes which
achieved wonders for civilization, but very
little for the pockets of the most wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
explorers the world has ever seen. Had it
not been for the presence of gold here—and
the supposed presence of even more
than has yet been dug—the western hemisphere
would be very much of a wilderness
still. It was the chase of the golden myths
which led to the astounding achievements
that opened the New World; and since then,
almost to this day, civilization has followed
with deliberate march only in the hasty
footprints of the gold seekers. No tale was
too wild to find credence with the early
adventurers.</p>

<p>The fabled ransom of Montezuma is <em>all</em> a
fable; but it is a fact that Atahualpa, the
head Inca of Peru, did pay to that marvelous
soldier Pizarro a ransom of golden vessels
sufficient to fill a room twenty-two by
seventeen feet to a height of nearly six
feet above the floor! While gold was not
much in use in Mexico, there was a great
deal of it employed in Peru for sacred
utensils and idols and for personal ornaments;
and to this day the “mummy
miners” are taking it out there. The
early Spanish discoveries of gold in North
America were unimportant, despite the
gilded myths which have surrounded them.
In Columbus’s time the gold fields of the
known world were so “worked out” that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
their product was barely enough to meet
the “wear and tear” of the precious metal
in use; so there was crying need of new
finds. But they came slowly.</p>

<p>By 1580 there were vague rumors of gold
in what is now California. Loyola Casallo,
a visiting priest, saw placer gold there, and
tells of it in his book written in 1690. In
the last century Antonio Alcedo speaks of
lumps of California gold, weighing from five
to eight pounds. But though its presence
was known, and though the rocky ribs of
the Golden State hid far more millions
than were dreamed of—and perhaps than
are dreamed of yet—there was little mining,
and that little with scant success.</p>

<p>The first gold discovery in the American
colonies was in Cabarrus county, North
Carolina, in 1799; and up to 1827 that state
was the only gold-producer in the Union.
In 1824 Cabarrus county sent the first
American gold to the mint in Philadelphia.
The Appalachian gold field, which embraces
part of Virginia, and stretches across North
Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia, touching
also parts of Tennessee and Alabama,
was once looked to for great things; but it
long ago dropped from all importance.</p>

<p>In 1828 the New Placers were discovered
in New Mexico, some fifty miles south of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Santa Fé, and for a great many years produced
richly. Even to this day they are far
from unproductive. Gold had been found
in New Mexico many generations before,
but never in quantities to come anywhere
near paying. A decade later, placer gold
was discovered in Santa Barbara county,
California, in the vast rancho of that gallant
old hidalgo whose home was described by
Mrs. Jackson as the home of “Ramona.”
These placers have been worked steadily
though clumsily by Mexicans ever since;
and I have a waxy nugget which was washed
out in Piru creek in 1838.</p>

<p>Within half a century the world’s supply
of gold had long been inadequate to the
growing demand. Russia was the chief
producer; and her mines—discovered about
1745—kept the nations from a “famine”
which would be most disastrous. There
were old mines in China, but little worked;
and though Japan’s gold output was large,
it was but a drop in the cosmopolitan
bucket. Russia at present, by the way,
produces an average of twenty millions of
gold a year.</p>

<p>The wonderful gold fields of Australia
were discovered in 1839 by Count Strzelcki;
but the priceless find was concealed, for a
curious reason. Australia was already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
England’s out-door prison; and it was
feared that if the golden news were known
the 45,000 desperate convicts there would
rise in rebellion and annihilate their keepers—as
they could well have done. So for
a dozen years the mighty secret was jealously
guarded; and thousands walked unsuspecting
over the dumb gravel that held
a million fortunes. In 1848 Rev. W. B.
Clark again stumbled upon the dangerous
secret, but again the discovery was suppressed;
and it was not until California
had set the whole world on fire with excitement
which nothing could bottle up, that
Australia threw off her politic mask. In
1851 E. H. Hargreaves, who had just come
from the new mines of California, saw that
Australia was geologically a gold country;
and his prospecting proved his surmises
correct. The news spread in spite of cautious
officials; and the wild epidemic of fortune
seekers pitted the face of the island-continent,
and watered its thirsty sands
with blood. Even yet, Australia is producing
over $45,000,000 gold a year.</p>

<p>The rich gold fields of New Zealand were
first found in 1842, but were not extensively
worked until 1856, when the swarming gold
hunters had overrun the Australian fields,
and the restless sought still easier wealth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>As I have told you, gold was mined spasmodically
in California much more than two
centuries ago, and steadily mined for more
than a decade before the “great discovery”
which was to change the face of an empire
and bring about what was in many ways
the most remarkable migration in the whole
history of the human race. But these early
diggings of the precious metal made little
stir. The swarthy miners delved away
quietly, exchanged their glittering “dust”
for rough food and other rude necessaries,
and made no noise. They were very much
out of the world. The telegraph, the railroad
and the printing press were far from
touch with them. There were a few “Americans”
in California, and even one or two
newspapers, but neither paid attention to
the occasional rumors of gold, save to
ridicule them.</p>

<p>But on the ninth day of February, 1848,
a little girl held in her unknowing hand the
key of the West—the wee yellow seed which
was to spring into one of the most wondrous
plants in history. On the American
fork of the Sacramento river, in what is
now El Dorado county, Cal., stood a shabby
little mill, owned by an American named
Sutter. (Californians, by the way, pronounce
the name “Soo´-ter.”) The mill race<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
became broken, and three men were hired
to repair it. Two were Mormons, and the
third, the overseer, was named Marshall.
As the men worked, Marshall’s little daughter
played about them—dreaming as little
as did her elders that she was to upset a
continent.</p>

<p>A yellow pebble in an angle of the sluice
caught her eye, and picking the pretty trifle
from the wet sand, she ran to her father
with, “Papa! see the pitty stone.” It was
indeed a pretty stone, and Marshall at once
suspected its value. Tests proved that he
was right, and gold was <em>really</em> found. The
discovery made some little noise among the
few Americans in that lonely, far land, but
nothing was known of it to the world until
Rev. C. S. Lyman, who saw some of the
nuggets which further search yielded,
wrote a letter to the <cite>American Journal of
Science</cite>, in March, 1848. As soon as the
news was in type, it spread swiftly to the
four ends of the earth, and already by August
of the same year four thousand excited
men were tearing up the sands of the American
Fork, and coaxing them to yield their
golden secrets. And well they succeeded,
for every day saw from $30,000 to $50,000
worth of gold washed out and transferred
to rude safes of bottles or buckskin sacks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
How long and high that gold fever raged;
how it patted the fearful intervening desert
with the weary footprints of tens
of thousands of modern Jasons; how it
brought around the Horn a thousand
heavy ships for every one that sailed before;
how it overturned and created anew
the money markets of the world; how it
turned a vast wilderness into the garden of
the world, and pulled the Union a thousand
miles over to the West, and caused the building
of such enormous railway lines as mankind
had never faintly dreamed of, and did
a thousand other wonders, you already
know—for it has made literature as well
as history. Our national history is crowded
with great achievements, but its chief romance
was—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“The days of old,</div>
<div class="verse">The days of gold,</div>
<div class="verse">The days of ’49.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>California produced $5,000,000 gold in
1848, and crazed the civilized world. The
output grew to $60,000,000 by 1852. To-day
the state yields between eleven and twelve
million dollars’ worth of gold a year, and it
creates no excitement whatever; for its people
are more occupied with mining the safer
gold of agriculture.</p>

<p>Of late years South Africa has entered
the field as one of the great gold countries.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Its annual “crop” is over forty millions.
There is a possibility that hereafter Alaska
will have to be added to the list. This
summer of 1897 between $3,000,000 and
$4,000,000 in “dust” and small nuggets came
out of the region generally and loosely called
“The Klondike.” I saw in the San Francisco
mint 152,000 ounces the returning
miners poured out from their buckskin
bags. Over 3,000 people left California under
the excitement caused by the exhibition
of these treasures, in a “gold-rush” which
recalled the old days, by its fever and its
follies; but the Klondike rush will probably
be remembered, whatever its results in
gold, as the most disastrous in history.
Instead of the mild climates of California,
Australia and South Africa (and thousands
lost health and life even there) the gold
seekers upon the Klondike will have to do
with the cruel winters and inhospitable
wildernesses of a land almost under the
Arctic Circle.</p>

<p class="tb">Of the various methods of liberating our
Yellow Slave from the hard clutches of the
earth it would be too long to speak in detail
here; but they are broadly divided into two
classes, according to the surroundings of
the gold itself. Free or “placer” gold—which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
was for centuries the first known to
mankind, and which was the sort that
started the great “fever” in California and
Australia—is found in beds of sand and
gravel, generally the present or former bed
of a stream. It is extracted—this precious
needle from an enormous and worthless
haystack—by means of its own weight;
water being applied in various manners to
give that weight a chance to assert itself.
The mixed gravel is given up to the mercies
of running water, which wets it
through, and causes its heaviest parts to
sink to the bottom, where they are held by
artificial obstacles, while the lighter particles
of sand are swept away by the natural
or artificial current. In this manner the
vast mass of soil is water-sifted until but
little is left; and from that little it is easy to
hunt out the coy yellow grains.</p>

<p>The placer gold was not formed in the
gravel banks where it is found, but came
there by the death of its mother rock. All
gold began in “veins” in the earth’s rocky
ribs; but Time, with his patient hammers
of wind and rain and frost, has pounded
vast areas of these rocks to sand; and the
gold, broken from great bands to lumps,
has drifted with the bones of the mountains
into the later heaps of gravel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>The processes of mining gold which still
remains in its original home in the rocks
are far more complicated. There is a vast
amount of boring to be done into the flinty
hearts of the mountains, with diamond-pointed
drills and with blasting; and then
the rock, which is dotted with the precious
yellow flakes, has to be crushed between the
steel jaws of great mills. Much of the gold
that is mined, too, is so chemically changed
that it does not look like gold at all, and requires
special chemical processes to coax
it out. In gold (and silver) mining mercury
is one of the most important factors.
It is the mineral sheriff, and swift to arrest
any fugitive fleck of gold that may come in
its way. The sluice boxes in extensive
placer mines, and the “sheets” in stamp
mills are all charged with quicksilver,
which saves a vast amount of the finer gold
dust that would be otherwise swept away
by the current of water—for water is
equally essential in both kinds of mining.</p>

<p>There is no such thing as pure gold,
often as we hear the phrase. Nature’s own
“virgin gold” is always alloyed with silver;
and the very purest is but 98 or 97 per cent
gold. California gold averages about the
fineness of our American coin—90 per cent
pure. As a general rule, the lighter the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
color the purer the gold. The beautiful red
gold gets its color from a large alloy of
copper.</p>

<p>It is an odd fact that the sea is full of
gold. No doubt at the bottom of that stupendous
basin which has received for all
time the washings of all the world, there
is an incalculable wealth of golden dust; but
the strange ocean mine is not all so deep
down as that. The sea water itself carries
gold in solution—a grain of gold to every
ton of water, as a famous chemist has
shown.</p>

<p>Among the historical big nuggets found
in various parts of the world, there have
been some wonderful yellow lumps. In
Cabarrus county, N. C., one was found in
1810 which weighed thirty-seven pounds
Troy. In 1842 the gold fields of Zlatoust,
in the Ural, gave a nugget of ninety-six
pounds Troy. The Victoria (Australia)
nugget weighed one hundred and forty-six
pounds and three pennyweights, of which
only six ounces was foreign rock; and the
Ballarat (Australia) nugget was thirty-nine
pounds heavier yet. The largest nugget
ever found was also dug in Australia—the
“Sarah Sands,” named for a far-off loved
one. It reached the astonishing weight of
two hundred and thirty-three pounds and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
four ounces Troy! I wonder what Miner
Sands felt when he stuck his pick into that
fortune in one lump!</p>

<p>The quality which makes gold commercially
the most valuable of the metals is its
docility. The cunning hammer of the smith
can “teach” it almost anything. The more
stubborn metals crumble after a certain
point; but gold can be hammered into a sheet
so infinitely fine that 282,000 of them, piled
one upon the other, would be but an inch
thick! And a flake of gold tiny as a pin-head
can be drawn out, a finer thread than
ever man spun, to a length of five hundred
feet!</p>

<p>There is no end to the uses of gold.
They broaden every day. In some one of
its many forms our Yellow Slave helps us
in almost every art and walk of life. It has
become as indispensable as its red fellow-slave,
fire—and like fire can be as bad a
master as it should be a good servant.</p>

<p>The most remarkable myths that appear
in American history are those
which were so eagerly listened to by the
early Spanish conquerors, who overran
two-thirds of the two Americas long before
the Saxons so much as attempted a foot-hold
in the New World. There was the
famous myth of El Dorado in South America—a
living man covered from head to foot
with pure gold dust and nuggets. In Mexico
was the fable of Montezuma’s untold
tons of gold and bushels of precious stones,
and many other impossible things. Ponce
de Leon, the gallant conqueror of Puerto
Rico, paid with his life for the credulity
which led him to the first of our states ever
entered by a European, in quest of an
alleged fountain of perpetual youth—a butterfly
which some of the world’s learned
doctors are still chasing under another
form. And all across the arid Southwest
the hot winds have scattered the dust of
brave but too-believing men who fell in the
desert through which they pursued some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
glittering shape of the American golden
fleece. When Alvar Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca,
the first American traveler, walked across
this continent from ocean to ocean, over
three hundred and fifty years ago, he heard
from the Indians many gilded myths, and
chief of them were those concerning the
famous Seven Cities of Cíbola. So enormously
abundant was gold said to be in these
Indian cities, that it was put to the meanest
uses. When Vaca got to the Spanish settlements
in Mexico and told this wonderful
report it made a great commotion, and soon
afterward that great explorer, Francisco
Vasquez de Coronado, came to the Seven
Cities of Cíbola—which surrounded the
site of the present Pueblo Indian town of
Zuñi in the extreme west of New Mexico.
But instead of the dazzling cities he expected,
Coronado found only seven adobe
towns, without an ounce of gold (or any
other metal, for that matter)—towns which
were wonderfully curious, but which sorely
disheartened the brave Spanish pioneers. A
little later Coronado heard equally astounding
tales of a still more golden aboriginal
city—the fabulous Gran Quivira—and set
out to find it. After a marvelous march
which took him almost to where Kansas
City now is, he found the Quivira—but no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
gold, of course. And it has been the same
ever since. Coronado’s footsore men ran
down their fables in 1541. Certainly not a
decade, and very likely not a year, has
passed since then in which some equally
preposterous story of incalculable treasures
has not been born and found followers in the
Southwest.</p>

<p>I know of but one thing in the world more
remarkable than that the Spaniards should
have believed such self-evident myths; and
that one thing is that so many, many Americans
believe them to-day. Not long ago I
visited the most remote and inaccessible
ruins in the Southwest, and found there the
work of these sanguine dupes, who had
actually dug through solid rock in search of
buried treasure. And even while I write a
party is digging, a hundred miles to the
west, for a treasure as mythical, and as
palpably so, as that at the end of the rainbow.
The stories of golden mountains, of
buried millions and of mysterious “lost
mines”—far richer, of course, than those
which any one can find—in New Mexico
alone would fill a volume.</p>

<p>I had once the good fortune to run across
some old and fragmentary Spanish manuscripts
of the last century and the beginning
of this, which are extremely interesting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
It is not often that we get so much
documentary evidence concerning the golden
will-o’-the-wisps which have lured so
many to disappointment and death. The
writings all bear the stamp of implicit belief,
and the old soldier, in particular, who
is the hero of the fragmentary story, is often
unconsciously eloquent and sometimes
pathetic in his recital. I translate all the
documents literally.</p>

<p>The first manuscript is a certified copy
(certified in the City of Mexico, March 5,
1803), of the “relation” and petition of Bernardo
de Castro, a copy for which the Spanish
governor of New Mexico had sent.
Bernardo’s story and appeal are as follows,
rendering as closely as possible the quaint
language of the day:</p>

<p>“<i>Most Excellent Sir</i>: Bernardo de Castro,
retired sergeant of the company of San
Carlos [St. Charles] of the government of
the City of Chihuahua, in the Provinces of
the Interior, admitted to citizenship in the
City of Santa Fé, capital of the kingdom of
New Mexico, and resident of this capital,
goes on and before Your Excellency says:
That having served our Royal Monarch for
the space of nine years and eight months as
sergeant of the said company in the countless
combats at which I assisted against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
nations of the ynfidels [Indians], I came out
with a lance-thrust in one leg, of the which
it resulted that I was placed in the Ynvalid
corps by the Sir Commander Don Juan de
Ugalde. But considering that with time
and medicines I recovered and gained
strength to seek my subsistence free from
the hardships to which the frontier troop
is exposed from the Mecos [probably the
Apaches], I gave up for the benefit of the
royal exchequer my pay as invalid sergeant,
and have followed working in the same
kingdom of New Mexico. There I have
suffered various fights—as it befell in the
past year of 1798, that while I was conducting
a multitude of large cattle and other
effects, the whole valued at more than
$14,000, from New Mexico to El Paso del
Norte, the barbarous Mecos assailed me,
and after a long battle, in which flowed
much human blood, they carried off all I
had in the world. And we gave to God
thanks for having saved us even the life.</p>

<p>“This continual contact with the savages
has contracted me a friendship with the
Cumanche nation, which is at peace with
the Spaniards, and understanding their
idiom facilitates me in trading with them to
gain my livelihood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>“In the past year, 1798, I arrived in Santa
Fé and presented myself to the Sir Governor
Don Fernando Chacon. His Lordship
informed me that there had come a
Frenchman and had shown him a piece of
metal of fine gold, assuring him he knew
the spot where it was produced, and that it
was a peak which the ynfidel nations called
Peak of the Gold, where there was such an
abundant breeding-place of this precious
metal that all the peak and even its surroundings
could with propriety be said to
be pure gold. That he offered to show the
spot if his Lordship would guard him with
three hundred men of troops, and this he
was bound to grant for the benefit of our
monarch. That the distance, he considered,
would be a matter of eight or nine
days’ journey. The faithful love to our
Sovereign animated the Sir Governor, and
he supplied the escort which had marched
two days before, and his said Lordship informed
me that if he had found me in the
city he would have made me one of the commanders.
This offer inspired me, and I
offered to follow after the expedition, and
the love with which I have always served
my lord, the King, enabled me by the utmost
exertion to overtake the expedition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
with which I incorporated myself on the
third day.</p>

<p>“And journeying on our course, on the
ninth day the French guide slipped away
from us, leaving us in the plains without
knowledge of the road to our desired peak.
At the which it was resolved by the leaders
of the expedition to return to Santa Fé.
But I, not suffering from the short march,
separated from the expedition and went on
alone to verify the report. And in the
rancherias [villages] of the Cumanches,
where I was entertained, when I told them
the trick and the mockery that the Frenchman
had put upon us, they assured me with
one accord that the said Frenchman did not
know the location of the peak at all, and
that he had never been there, for the gold
which he took to New Mexico they themselves
had given him in exchange for various
trinkets of coral, belts and other trifles.
But that they knew the peak of gold,
that was indeed with an abundance never
seen before, and if I would go with them
they would show me it, and I could pick up
all I wished, and if we met any other nation
[of Indians] I should not be harmed if with
them, for they were all friends.</p>

<p>“Indeed, most illustrious Sir, only by my
fidelity and obedience to my superior could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
I contain myself not to march to the peak
without delay; and I told my friends the
Mecos Cumanches, that I was going to seek
permission of that Sir Governor of the New
Mexico, and with it would return. I arrived
in Santa Fé and sought that permission,
but it was denied me. But continuing
my visits to the Mequeria [I find that] so
strong a desire have they formed for the
granting of that permission and the development
of this treasure, and the facility
there is that the Spaniards enjoy it and that
their Sovereign make heavy his royal coffers,
that I resolved to make a walk of more
than seven hundred leagues to seek the aid
and encouragement of Your Excellency.
[The brave sergeant so fully believed in his
Peak of Gold that he actually walked nearly
2,200 miles alone through a most dangerous
country to lay the matter before the Viceroy
in Mexico.]</p>

<p>“My plan being approved, it is undeniable
that the Royal treasury will be
swelled by the tithes and dues to the Royal
crown; new interest will animate men to
follow up the discovery, and there will be
civilized (with time and the friendship
which is contracted with the nations of the
Cumanches, Yutas and Navajosos) more
than three hundred leagues of virgin and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
powerful lands—that being reckoned the
distance from the city of Santa Fé to the
Peak of Gold. The inhabitants of the internal
provinces, who now live under the
yoke of the assaults of the hostile Indians,
will revive; it will be easier for the Sovereign
to guard the frontiers of these his
vast dominions. Settlements will be made,
and insensibly will follow the conquest and
pacification of the ynfidels, who will easily
embrace the holy Gospel and come under
the faith of Jesus Christ. What results to
religion, to the monarch and to his vassals
are presented, even by this clumsy narration!</p>

<p>“I do not intend to burden the Royal
treasury with the slightest expense, nor do
I think to involve the Royal arms in actions
which might imperil the troops. My person
is declared past its usefulness for the
Royal service, and I count myself as a dead
man for entering matters of importance.
But my military spirit does not falter, and I
only desire to manifest, even at the foot of
the tomb, my love to my Sovereign. With
only one faithful companion I intend to go
among my friends, the Cumanches, and,
with the protection and guidance of them,
to enter and explore the land, silently, without
noise or preparation, to force a passage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Quietness, the gray shadows of the night
and our own courage are the only preparations
I make for the difficult undertaking,
and, above all, the divine aid. Having
found the desired Peak of Gold, charted
the roads to it, made the due surveys, and
gathered so much of the precious metal as
we can transport without making danger
(and under the divine favor), I will present
myself again to Your Excellency, and by
your Superiority will be taken such steps as
the state of the case demands.</p>

<p>“Under which considerations, and the
solid arguments which I have expressed, of
which Your Excellency can receive full confirmation
from the most excellent Señor
Don Pedro de Nava, commander-in-chief of
the interior provinces, and Don Joseph
Casiano Feaomil y Garay, lieutenant-captain
of dragoons of San Luís Potosí, I humbly
beg of Your Excellency that in use of your
Viceroyal powers, you deign to grant me
your superior permission to go in search of
the Peak of Gold; being kind enough to send
to the Señor Don Fernando Chacon, actual
Governor of the New Mexico, that he put
no difficulty in my path, and giving orders
to the captains and chiefs of the friendly
nations—Cumanches, Yutas and Navajosos—that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
they accompany and guide me in this
expedition.</p>

<p>“And I respectfully say that my delay in
getting to this Capital [the City of Mexico]
was because I had to come nearly all the
way on foot, my horse having given out in
that great distance, and that now I am supported
here by alms, such is my great anxiety
for the benefit of the monarch, and
beg that I be excused for this paper. [He
was too poor to buy the stamped and taxed
paper on which petitions to the Viceroy
must be addressed.]</p>

<p>“For so much I pray Your Excellency’s
favor.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Bernardo Castro.</span>”</p>

<p>He had the real spirit of the Argonauts,
this crippled old soldier, to whom poverty
and danger and 2,000-mile walks were trifles
when they stood between him and his Peak
of Gold.</p>

<p>The Viceroy evidently gave the desired
permission—without which, under the
strict Spanish laws, no such venture was to
be thought of—and there were one or more
expeditions, but unfortunately we have left
no account of them. It is clear that the
Viceroy ordered Governor Chacon, of New
Mexico, to assist Castro in his undertaking,
and that the matter aroused a good deal of
interest throughout the provinces of New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
Spain. Don Nemecio Salcedo, military commandant
at Chihuahua, seems to have interested
himself in the matter, for the next
document in this fragmentary series is a
draft of a reply to him from Governor
Chacon, as follows:</p>

<p>“According to that which Your Lordship
advises me in communication of the 16th
of September of the current year, I repeat
that as to the expedition of Bernardo Castro
to the discovery of the Peak of Gold, I will
help him and the others who accompany
him, that they may have no difficulty with
the General of the Cumanches, whom, however,
I have not yet seen, since he has not
yet returned with the ransom he offered me
when he was last in this capital.</p>

<p>“God, etc. Santa Fee, 25th of Fber, 1803.</p>

<p>“To Señor Don Nemo. Salcedo.”</p>

<p>There was other correspondence between
these two on the same matter, for
now we come to an original letter from
Commandant Salcedo to Governor Chacon,
replying to a late one of his. It says:</p>

<p>“The communication of Your Lordship,
No. 36, of the 18th of last November, leaves
me informed of all the assistances you gave
Bernardo Castro, that he might undertake
the second journey [so he had already made
one] from that city, with the object to discover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
the Peak of Gold, which he has described
in the territory of that province.
And of the results I hope Your Lordship
will give me account.</p>

<p>“God guard Your Lordship many years.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Chihuahua</span>, January 5, 1804.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Nemecio Salcedo.</span></p>

<p>“To the Sir Governor of New Mexico.”</p>

<p>Poor brave, misguided Bernardo de Castro!
I wish we might have more of the
documents about his venturesome wanderings
in quest of the Peak of Gold. He
must have gone far out into the wastes of
Texas; and at last he, too, yielded up his
life, as did countless of his countrymen
before him, to that deadliest of yellow fevers.
We lose all track of him until Governor
Chaves writes from Santa Fé, in
1829, to his superior in the City of Mexico,
who had written to ask him about these
and other matters. His letter says:</p>

<p>“<i>Most Excellent Sir</i>: In compliance with
that which Your Excellency requests in
your official letter of the 19th of August
last, that I make the necessary verifications
upon the mineral reported by the Rev.
Father Custodian of these missions, Fray
Sevastian Alvares, to be found among the
gentile Comanches, I have investigated the
matter, and place in the knowledge of Your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Excellency that which various of the citizens
of this capital—and all of them most
veracious—say. They all agree in that it
is a fact that Don Bernardo de Castro [the
old soldier had evidently won honorable recognition,
else a Governor of New Mexico
would not speak of him by the respectful
title of “Don”] entered this territory with
the object of seeking the said mineral; that
he made various expeditions with this object,
until in one of them he was slain by
the heathen Apaches.</p>

<p>“Passing to information received from
the travelers to that nation, all agree in the
statement that the Comanches offer to sell
them pouches filled with a metal which appears
fine and of great weight, which they
say they get from the neighborhood of the
Ash peaks (which are very well known to
our people, but not explored or charted,
because they are distant from the trails).</p>

<p>“The citizen Pablo Martin has been he
who expressed himself most fully. He,
knowing that the said Don Bernardo de
Castro sought a mineral in the Comanche
nation, has procured them to look for the
said mineral. The only result was that
one Comanche named Paño de Lienso
[‘Cloth of Linen’], who made himself his
companion, gave him information that beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
the Ash peaks, in some round hills,
were stones with much silver, whereof the
said Comanche had carried some to the
province of San Antonio de Bejar [Texas],
where they made buttons for him. He who
made the buttons charged the Comanche to
bring him a load [of that metal], but he did
not do so, because in that time came the
war of his people with that province. Other
Comanches also have told him [Pablo Martin]
that in said spot were stones with
silver.</p>

<p>“This is all I have been able to find out
as the results of my investigations, the
which I place in the knowledge of Your Excellency,
that you may put it to the use
which you deem best.</p>

<p>The yellow cottonwoods above the Rio
Grande shivered in the fresh October
morning as the sun peeped over the
Eagle Feather mountain into the valley of
his people. Above the flat, gray pueblo of
Shee-eh-huíb-bak the bluish breath of five
hundred slender chimneys melted skyward
in tall spirals. Upon here and there a level
housetop a blanket-swathed figure stared
solemnly at the great, round, blinding
house of T’hoor-íd-deh, the Sun Father.</p>

<p>Then a burro, heavy eared and slow of
pace, rattled the gravel on the high bluff,
gazed mournfully on the muddy eddies, and
broke out in stentorian brays. Apparently
Flojo<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> felt downcast. Across these treacherous
quicksands the grass was still tall in
the <i lang="es">vega</i>—why did not Pablo take him over
too? And mustering up his ears, he trotted
almost briskly down the slope to the water’s
edge, where a swart young Apollo was just
stepping into the swift current. Tall,
sinewy, lithe as Keem-eé-deh, the mountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
lion that lent its tawny hide for the bow-case
in his hand; his six feet of glowing
bronze broken only by a modest clout of
white at the supple waist, his dense black
hair falling straight upon broad, bare
shoulders, and his dark eyes watchful of
the swirling waters, the young Pueblo
strode sturdily in, paying no heed to the
forlorn watcher upon the shore. In a moment
he was in the channel swimming
easily, one hand holding the bow-case above
the red bundle upon his jet crown. <em>Sush-sh!
sush-sh! splosh! splash! splash!</em> and
Flojo heaved a great sigh as his master
went spattering across the farther shoals,
and at last climbed the sandy eastern
bank.</p>

<p>Pablo unrolled the bundle from his head,
wriggled, wet-skinned, into the red print
shirt and snowy <i lang="es">calzoncillos</i>, wrapped their
flapping folds about his calf with the buckskin
leggings of rich maroon; belted these
at either knee with a wee, gay sash from
the looms of Moqui, fastened the moccasins
with their silver buttons, and, with the
tawny sheath of bow and arrows slung
across his back, started at a swift walk.
Once only he stopped, after a scramble up
the gravel hills that scalloped the plateau,
to look back a moment. The long ribbon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
of the valley, now faded from its summer
green, banded the bare brown world from
north to south, threaded with the errant
silver of the river, whose farthest shimmer
flashed back from under the purple mass of
the Mountain of the Thieves. Midway lay
the pueblo, dozing amid its orchards below
the black cone of the Kú-mai, and Pablo
shook his head sadly, as he turned again
and strode across the broad, high <i lang="es">llano</i>.</p>

<p>“It is not well in the village,” he muttered,
“for it is full of them that have the
evil road. The Cum-pah-huít-lah-wen have
told me that the half of those of Shee-eh-huíb-bak
are witches; but not all can be
punished. But it is in ill times for us.
<i lang="es">Tio</i> Lorenzo is twisted by the Bads so that
he cannot walk; and many die; and did not
Ámparo and José Diego marry the prettiest
maidens of the Tee-wahn, only to find them
witches? How shall one take a wife when
so many are accursed? It is better to hunt
and forget the women, as do the warriors;
for we know not who are True Believers,
and who have to do with the ghosts.”</p>

<p>Across the wide, sandy plateau the young
Indian walked with undiminished pace; and
as the house of the Sun Father stood in the
middle of the sky, he entered a rocky cañon
of the Eagle Feather mountain and began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
to climb a spur of the great peak. The
huddled dry leaves under a live oak caught
his eye, and he turned them with deft foot.
“Here Pee-íd-deh, the deer, slept last
night,” he exclaimed, “for the fresh earth
clings to their under side. And here is a
hair, and here the footmark. If only Keem-eé-deh
will help me.”</p>

<p>Kneeling by the tree, he broke off a twig
and stuck it in the earth in front of the footprint,
the fork pointing backward, that
Pee-íd-deh might trip and fall as it ran.
Then, drawing the Left-Hand Pouch from
his side, he opened it and reverently took
out a tiny parcel in buckskin, whose folds
soon disclosed a little image of the Mountain
Lion, chief of hunters, carved from
adamantine quartz. Its eyes were of the
sacred turquoise; and in the center of the
belly was inlaid a turquoise heart over the
hollow which held a pinch of the holy corn
meal. On the right side was lashed a tiny
arrow-head of moss agate—one of the precious
“thunder knives” which the Horned
Toad had made and had left for Pablo on
the plains of the Hollow Peak of Winds.
Putting the fetich to his mouth and inhaling
from the stone lips, the hunter prayed
aloud to Keem-eé-deh to give him true eyes
and ears, and swift feet to overtake; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
rising, gave a low, far roar to terrify the
heart and loosen the knees of his prey.
Then, restoring the image to its pouch, with
bow in hand and three arrows held ready,
he pushed rapidly up hill, with keen eyes to
the dim trail. Here a trampled grass blade,
there a cut leaf or overturned pebble, and
again a faint scratch on the rocks, led him
on. At last, just where the flat top of the
mountain had been wrought to a vast arrow-point
by the Giant of the Caves, he saw a
sleek doe standing under a shabby aspen.
Down on his belly went Pablo, and with a
new breath-taking from the stone lips of the
prey-god, crawled snake-like forward. The
deer moved not, and within fifty yards Pablo
tugged an arrow to its agate head and
drove it whirring through Pee-íd-deh’s
heart. The doe turned her great, soft eyes
toward him, sniffed the air and went bounding
up the rocky ledges as if unhurt. Yet
on the left side the grey feathers of the
shaft touched the skin; and once on the
right Pablo caught the sparkle of the gem
tip.</p>

<p>There was a curious ashen tint in the
bronze of his cheeks, as the hunter sprang
to his feet and began running in pursuit.
“Truly, that was to the life,” he whispered
to himself. “And why does she not fall?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
Will it be that they of the evil road have
given me the eye?” And stopping short, he
fished out a bit of corn husk and a pinch of
the sweet <i>pee-én-hleh</i> and rolled a cigarette,
lighting it from his flint and steel. The
first puff he blew slowly to the east, and
then one to the north, and one to the west,
and one south, one overhead, and one downward,
all about, that the evil spirits of the
Six Ways might be blinded and not see his
tracks. When the sacred <i>weer</i> was smoked,
he rose and took up the trail again. It was
easy to be followed, now, in the soft wood
soil of the mountain top; and in the very
edge of the farther grove of aspens he saw
the doe again, grazing in unconcern. Worming
from tree to tree, Pablo came close, and
again sent a stone-tipped shaft. It struck
by the very side of the first, and drank as
deep; but the doe, pricking up her ears as
if she had but heard the whizz of the arrow,
trotted easily away and disappeared over
the eastern brow of the mountain, amid the
somber pines.</p>

<p>Pablo was very pale now, but not yet
daunted. He smoked again to the Six Ways
and prayed to all the Trues to help him,
and with another arrow on the string,
pushed forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>Where the tall pines dwindled to scrubby
cedars he came again to his quarry. But
now the doe was more alert and would not
let him within bowshot. Only she looked
back at him with big, sad eyes and trotted
just away from range. And soon Night
rolled down the mountain from behind him
and filled the whispering forest and drowned
the great, still plains beyond, and he lost
her altogether.</p>

<p>“This is no deer,” said Pablo, gloomily,
as he stretched himself under a twisted
<i lang="es">savino</i> for the night, “but one who has <i>wahr</i>,
the Power. And her eyes, how they are as
those of women sorrowing, large and wet!
But I will see the end, even though I die.”
And weary with the rugged forty miles of
the day, he was soon asleep.</p>

<p>As the blue flower of dawn bloomed from
the eastern gray, Pablo rose, and smoked
again the sacred smoke and inhaled the
strengthful breath of Keem-eé-deh, and
started anew on his awesome hunt. Soon
he found the trail marked with dark
blotches, and all day long he followed it.
Just as the sun-house stood on the dark
western ridges he came to the foot of a high
swell, on whose summit gleamed the gray
of strange, giant walls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>“It will be the bones of Ta-bi-rá,” thought
Pablo aloud, “for my father often told me
of the great city of the Pi-ro that was beyond
Cuaray in the First Times, before the
lakes of the plain were accursed to be salt,
before Those-of-the-Old came to dwell on
the river that runs from the Dark Lake of
Tears. But how shall a deer come thus
into the plains, which are only of the prong-horns?<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
Yet I have walked in her road all
day, and here are her marks, going”—and
he stopped, for his sharp ear caught a faint,
far-off chant. It seemed to come from the
ruins that crowned the hill; and, dropping
to the earth, Pablo began to crawl from
cedar to cedar, from rock to rock toward it.
At the very crest of the rounded ridge was
a long line of jumbled stone—the mound of
fallen fortress houses—and beyond, from
the gathering dusk, loomed the ragged,
lofty walls of a vast temple. Under the
shadows of the mound he crawled far
around to the rear end of the gray wall, and
then along the wall itself toward the huge
buttresses that proclaimed its front. The
chant was close at hand now—the singer
was evidently within the ruined temple.
But the tongue Pablo did not know. It was
not so musical as his soft Tee-wahn, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
was it like the guttural of the Quéres—for
that he knew also—and yet it was some
voice of the Children of the Sun, and not the
outlandish babble of the Americanoodeh,
nor of the Spanish Wet-Head. It was not,
then, some new <i lang="es">tonto</i> come to dig for the
fabled gold of Ta-bi-rá—whose shafts
yawned black in the gray bedrock and here
and there through the very base of the
great wall—but some Indian, and probably
a medicine man, for the song was not as
those of the careless. Pablo crouched in
the darkness against the eastern end of the
wall, listening, forgetful of the bewitched
deer and of all else. Once in a wild swell
of the song he thought he discerned a
familiar word.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;" id="illus5">
<img src="images/illus5.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“THE BONES OF TA-BI-RÁ”</p>
</div>

<p>“Hoo-máh-no?” he kept repeating to himself.
“Surely, the grandfather Desidério
said me that word when he told of Them-of-the-Old,
when They-with-Striped-Faces
dwelt on yonder mesa. But they are all
dead these many years.”</p>

<p>A swift, short flash split the darkness,
and a growl of far thunder rolled across the
ruins. Pablo glanced at the heaven. It
was sown thick with the bright sky-seeds
that flew up when the Coyote disobeyed
the Trues and opened the sacred bag.
From horizon to horizon there was not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
cloud; but again the flash came, and again
the mighty drum-beat of Those Above.
Pablo crept to a breach in the wall, and
peeped into the gloomy interior of the
temple. Even as he looked, the zig-zag
arrow of the Trues leaped again from
ghostly wall to wall; and its blinding flight
showed him that at which he caught his
breath. For squat by a corner in the wall
was a white-headed Indian waving his bare
arms; and facing him and Pablo a dusky
maiden, with drooping head. But her face
was burned into his heart.</p>

<p>“Surely, such are precious to the Trues!
For she is as the Evening Star, good to
see!” and Pablo craned forward eagerly.
“The <i lang="es">viejo</i> will be a Shaman,” he added,
mentally, “for so our own Fathers make
the lightning come at the medicine dance.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
But she! If there were such in Shee-eh-huíb-bak,
then one might take a wife—for
her face is no face of a witch!”</p>

<p>Just then there came another flash; and
then a soft, girlish cry. The magic lightning
of the conjurer had betrayed Pablo;
and before he could spring away a heavy
hand was upon his shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>“<i>Hi-ma-tu-kú-eh?</i>” demanded a deep voice
in an unknown tongue.</p>

<p>“<i>Nah Tee-wah</i>,” said the abashed hunter,
trying in vain to shake off that strong
grasp.</p>

<p>“Tee-wah?” said the stranger, speaking
in Pablo’s own language. “I, too, have the
tongue of Shee-eh-huíb-bak, for my wife
was of there. But now she has gone to
Shee-p’ah-poón, and there lives for me only
my child, and she is hurt. But what hast
thou here, peeping at our medicine?”</p>

<p>“It is by chance, Kah-báy-deh,” answered
Pablo. “For yesterday when the sun was
<em>so</em>, I wounded a deer, and unto here I have
followed it in vain. For, perhaps, it has the
Power, and I could not kill it. And when
I heard thy song I came, not knowing what
it was.”</p>

<p>“Since yesterday when the sun was <em>so</em>,
thou hast followed the road of a wounded
deer? And how wounded?”</p>

<p>“In truth, I gave it two arrows through
the life, but it minded them not.”</p>

<p>“Come, then, and thou shalt see thy
hunting,” and he drew Pablo into the temple.
In a moment a dry arm of the <i lang="es">entraña</i>
(which the Trues gave for the first candles)
was burning; and by its smoky, flaring
light Pablo could see his strange surroundings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Beside him, that breakless hand still
on his shoulder, stood an aged Indian. His
hair was white as the snows of Shoo-p’ah-toó-eh,
and his undimmed eyes shone from
deep under snowy brows. He was naked
but for the breech-clout, and upon his left
arm was a great gauntlet from the forepaw
of Ku-aí-deh, the bear, with all its claws.
But at his wrinkled face Pablo stared in
affright, for all across it ran long, savage
knife-stripes, so old that they, too, were cut
with wrinkles. “<i lang="es">Rayado!</i>” flashed through
the young hunter’s mind, “even as were
They-of-the-Old who dwelt in the mesa of
the Hoo-máh-no! But they are all dead since
long ago.”</p>

<p>But even his superstitious terror could
not keep his eyes from that modest figure
crouched in the angle of the strange wall.
Truly, she was good to look at. In the soft
olive of the cheeks a sweet, deep red was
spreading. Under the downcast eyes the
lashes drew dark lines across the translucent
skin. A flood of hair poured into her
lap, and from under its heavy waves peeped
a slender hand. It was plain from her dress
that she was none of the <i lang="es">bárbaros</i>, but a
Pueblo. There was the same modest black
<i lang="es">manta</i> of his people, the same fat, boot-like
leg-wraps of snowy buckskin, the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
dainty brown moccasins. Even the heavy
silver rosary was about her neck, and from
her ears hung strands of precious turquoise
beads from the white, blue-veined heart of
Mount Chalchihuitl. But even the white silver,
and the stone that stole its color from
the sky were not precious beside that sweet
young face from which Pablo could not turn
away.</p>

<p>And as he gazed with a strange warm
tickling at his heart strings, the long lashes
lifted timidly toward the handsome stranger,
and on a sudden the bright face turned
ashen, and the girl sank back upon a heap
of fallen stones. Pablo stared with wide
eyes, and a dizziness ran from head to knee,
for there were dark drops upon the rocks,
and amid the flowing hair he saw the notched
ends of two arrows—his very own, feathered
from the gray quills of Koor-níd-deh,
the crane. He reeled, to fall, but the strong
hand held him up and the strong voice said:</p>

<p>“Take the heart of a man, for it is not yet
too late. Thou hast done this, unknowing;
for the witches filled thine eyes with smoke,
to fool thee. But we will yet make medicine
to heal my daughter—for I am the wizard
T’bó-deh, the last of the Hoo-máh-no, and
precious to Those Above, who will help us.
But thou hast still arrows in the quiver—go,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
then, till thou come to the first cliff on
the west, and shoot three arrows strongly
into the sky. And bring to me that which
falls—for it needs that thou who hast shed
her blood shouldst bring it again. Nay,
tremble not, for the Trues will help thee;
and with this amulet of the striped stone
the witches cannot come nigh. Take the
heart of a man, and go!”</p>

<p>Pablo looked at the pitiful little heap in
the corner, and turning, manfully strode
out through the broad portal and went
stumbling westward in the darkness, over
mounds and hollows and fallen walls. Down
the long, steep ridge, across the undulant
plain, knee-deep in dry and whispering
grass, and up the western slope of the valley
he trudged; and at last in the darkness
ran up against a smooth, straight face of
rock. “It is the cliff,” he shivered—for he
feared greatly. But plucking up his soul,
he backed away a few paces from the rock
and notched a shaft and drew it to the head
and sent it hurtling to the sky, and another
and another. For a long time he waited,
and then there was a soft <em>whish!</em> and an
arrow stood in the earth at his feet. He
groped and found it and drew back his hand
quickly, for shaft and feathers were wet—with
that soft, warm, ticklish wetness that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
never came from water yet. Another arrow
fell and it was so, and so also was the third.</p>

<p>Shaken as are the leaves of the shivering
tree,<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Pablo put to his lips the amulet of
the wizard and drew a long breath from it.
Then, gingerly plucking the standing arrows
one by one, he started running from
the haunted spot, not resting in his stumbling
flight until he found himself at the foot
of the hill of Ta-bi-rá. In a few moments
he was groping along the great wall, and at
last stood again within the roofless temple.</p>

<p>Now there was a tiny fire there, and the
old man was squatted by it chanting and
snapping two long feathers together in
rhythm with his wild refrain. And in the
corner was the same dark, limp heap, which
seemed to drift near or farther away on the
waves of the firelight.</p>

<p>“It is well!” said the old man, rising;
“for already I have blown away the evil
ones, that we be alone. And I see that thou
hast brought blood from above to pay for
that which is lost.”</p>

<p>Taking from Pablo’s hand the arrows,
still red-wet, he broke one over the fire and
one he thrust upright in the hard earth at
the maiden’s feet. Then he rubbed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
hands with ashes and laid them upon her
breast, chanting:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Blood, water of life,</div>
<div class="verse">Come back in the brooks of the heart!</div>
<div class="verse">Blood, water of life,</div>
<div class="verse">Give it to drink again—</div>
<div class="verse">For the red field is dry</div>
<div class="verse">And nothing grows.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As he rubbed and sang the maiden stirred
and moved and sat up. And taking the
third arrow he put the notch to his lips and
the barb to her side and drew with a strong
breath, and the buried shaft grew long and
longer from her side, until it fell upon the
ground. So he drew the second shaft, and
it, too, came away and left her.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Then he
laid the arrow of power against her side
and the wounds were no more there; and
she rose and took the hand of Pablo to her
little mouth and breathed on it, and looked
up at him with timid eyes, but Pablo sank
down and knew nothing, for his strength
was done.</p>

<p>When he woke, the Sun-Father was high
over the gray ruins. Pablo found himself
upon a bed of dry grass, in the shadow of
the wall; and near him sat the old man who
was last of the Hoo-máh-no, watching him
with clear eyes. A low, sweet voice was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
crooning a sleep-song in his own tongue;
and from behind a jutting wall peeped forth
a little moccasined foot.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Sleep! Sleep! It is good!</div>
<div class="verse">Sleep the Moon-Mother gave—</div>
<div class="verse">She that bought us the night,</div>
<div class="verse">Paying her sight to buy!</div>
<div class="verse">Sleep! For so She is glad!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Pablo sat up, bending forward if he
might see the singer; but there was only a
gleam of soft eyes around the wall, and
then they were gone. The old man eyed
him kindly. He was dressed now like
Pablo, with the garments of the Pueblos;
and the stern, quiet face, with its strange
scar-stripes, seemed after all very good.</p>

<p>“Thou hast slept well, son,” he said at
last, “for we have been here many hours.
But it is hard to fight them of the evil road,
and for that thou wast tired. But rise
now, eat and be strong, for other days
come.”</p>

<p>As he spoke the maiden came bringing a
steaming earthen bowl and set it down timidly
before the stranger, at whom she dared
not look, and disappeared again in her nook.
The hot broth revived the young hunter,
and a new heart came in him and he was
strong. When he had eaten, the old man
said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now thou art a man again. Tell me
how goes with the village of the Tee-wahn?
For in fifty winters I have not seen Shee-eh-huíb-bak—since
my wife had come from
there to P’ah-que-toó-ai, where I loved her.
Is it well with the town? Do they keep the
ways of the Old?”</p>

<p>“There are many True Believers,” answered
Pablo slowly, “but many have forgotten
the ways of the Old and taken the
evil road, so that it is hard to know who are
good, there are so many witches. For that,
the young men that believe in the Olds are
afraid to make nests, lest they find feathers
of the accursed birds therein—for many
that look to be snowbirds are inwardly owls
and woodpeckers.”</p>

<p>“And thou hast no nest?” asked the old
man with a keen glance.</p>

<p>“<i>In-dáh-ah!</i>” replied Pablo emphatically—and
from the corner he caught a bright
gleam of eyes.</p>

<p>“It is well! For if the nest be bad, how
shall the young birds grow up clean? And
thy parents?”</p>

<p>“My father was War Captain of the Tee-wahn,”
said Pablo proudly, “and he taught
me the ways of men, and the sacred stories
of the Old. But one gave him the evil eye,
and he was slain by the Cumanche in war.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
My mother was a True Believer, and soon
she went after him, to make his house good
in Shee-p’ah-poón. So there is left only my
grandfather, who is cacique, and my uncle.
And with my uncle I live, for we are both
of the Eagle clan.”</p>

<p>“It is well! But now it is to stay here
for a time; for in this place is mighty power
of the Olds. But if thou wilt hunt for us,
that Deer-Maiden may eat well while I fast
and talk with Those Above, then we will
go with thee to Shee-eh-huíb-bak; for my
people are no more and my child is lonely
to be with the people of her mother. But
show me the <i>wahr</i> with which thou huntest,
for perhaps the witches have blinded it.”</p>

<p>Pablo fished out the little stone image,
which he had never shown to man before,
and T’bó-deh inhaled from its lips.</p>

<p>“It is so!” he said angrily; and prying
out the turquoise heart he showed the hunter
that from beneath it the sacred meal
was gone, and in its place a tiny black
feather. “It is no wonder that thy hunting
was ill,” he cried, “for the witches have
changed the heart of Keem-eé-deh! But I
will give thee a strong <i>wahr</i> that none can
kill,” and breaking the polluted image with
a rock, he covered the fragments with a
cloth and chanted a sacred song. In a moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
the cloth moved, and the wizard drew
from under it a bright new Keem-eé-deh,
carved from the sunlight-stone, the yellow
topaz, and bound to its side was an arrow-head
of transparent emerald. Its heart was
turquoise and its eyes red garnets.</p>

<p>“Take it, son, and fear not,” said the aged
conjurer, “for it is stronger than the ghosts.
But now go and hunt, for there is no more
meat.”</p>

<p>When Pablo toiled up the hill of ruins at
sundown a noble antelope was balanced
upon his shoulders and a fat wild turkey
dangled from his belt. He threw them down
proudly, and was paid with a shy glance
from the eyes that now lived in his heart,
and the old man said:</p>

<p>“The new <i>wahr</i> is good! And thou art
a hunter like Keem-eé-deh himself. Verily
there will be no lack of meat in thy house.”
But at this the maiden ran away with a red
face, and Pablo’s heart was glad.</p>

<p>For three days they were there while the
old man made medicine; and every day
Pablo brought back much game. And every
day his eyes grew deeper and those of the
maiden drooped lower. On the fourth day
they started, the three, to the northeast;
and with three journeys they came to Shee-eh-huíb-bak.
There Pablo brought the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
strangers to his grandfather, the cacique;
and when old Desidério knew that this was
the great wizard, the last of the Hoo-máh-no,
he was very glad, and gave him of the
common lands, that his home should be always
there.</p>

<p>When the people of Shee-eh-huíb-bak
were making clean for the Noche Buena,
Pablo came to the cacique, and said: “<i lang="es">Tata</i>,
there is another year, and I am tired to be
alone.”</p>

<p>“But canst thou keep a wife?”</p>

<p>“Thou knowest, <i lang="es">tata</i>, that none kill more
game. As for my fields, they are good, and
the careless-weed never grows there.”</p>

<p>“It is truth, my son. And who is good in
thine eyes?”</p>

<p>“There is only one, <i lang="es">tatita</i>, and that is
Deer-Maiden, the child of the Hoo-máh-no.
She is very good.”</p>

<p>“I like her,” answered the withered cacique,
slowly, “for her father has given
her a good heart, and they are both precious
to Those Above. It is well.”</p>

<p>In four days the cacique and the Hoo-máh-no
brought Pablo and the Deer-Maiden
to the cacique’s house and gave them to eat
two ears of raw corn—to him a blue ear,
but to her a white one, for a woman’s heart
is always whiter. Pablo looked at her as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
he ate, but she could not look. And when
both had proved themselves by eating the
last grain, the elders took them out to the
sacred running-place and put them side by
side, and marked the course, and gave them
the road. Then Pablo went running like a
strong antelope, but the girl like a scared
fawn; and up the sacred hill they flew, and
turned at the Stone of the Bell, and came
flying back. But now Pablo was slower,
for it is not well to surpass one’s bride in
the marrying race, as if one would rob her
of respect; and if they come in equal, there
is no marriage. So she was first; and all
the people blessed them, and they were one.
No witch could ever harm their house, for
He-that-Was-Striped gave them strong
<i>wahr</i>, and they were happy.</p>

<h3>Candelária’s Curse.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 50px;">
<img src="images/deco-chap.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="" />
</div>

<p>What a snip-click! snip-click! snip-click!
of the big steel shears, till the
corral rang like an exaggerated telegraph
office! Hoarse voices kept calling out
“<i lang="es">Numer’ uno!</i>” “<i lang="es">dieziseis!</i>” “<i lang="es">veintetres!</i>”
and tall, handsome Lorenzo, standing in a
corner with the tally card in his hand, penciled
a mark opposite No. 1, No. 16, No. 23,
and so on as each man called out the number
by which he was known. The calls
came fast, and for each one a shabby gray
shadow, looking like the ghost of a boy
with a home hair-cut, “only more so,” went
scurrying into the ranks of his yet unshorn
fellows. The big corral was full as it could
hold. Fifteen hundred sheep were there,
so tightly packed that a mouse tossed upon
their backs could hardly have found its way
to the ground between them. Only in the
triangular corners of the fence (which was
built of logs laid up in zigzags) was there a
trifle of room; and it was from these that
all the noise came. In each was a fast-swelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
heap of dirty, gray wool, and just
in front of it the shearer. Each, as he
turned a victim loose, yelled out his number,
to be tallied one, and running upon the
huddled mass of sheep, caught one by the
fleece with each hand, dragged it to his
corner, flopped it upon its side, knotted its
four sharp feet together with a dextrous
movement, and, snatching the shears from
his belt, fell instantly to work. It was a
scene to bewilder an Eastern sheep-grower.
There were no shearing tables. Each man
bent over, as though there were a hinge in
his waist, until his hands were within six
inches of the ground, and thus worked all
day long. Holding and turning the sheep
with the left hand, with the right he drove
the sharp blades snipping through the wool
with startling rapidity—till, almost before
one knew it, the whole fleece rolled off to
one side, very much as if it had been an unbroken
pelt. As quick a motion freed the
feet again and the shorn creature scrambled
up and ran to hide his confusion, while the
shearer was already playing barber to the
“next gentleman.”</p>

<p>So it was no sleepy work, tallying for the
thirty-seven swart fellows who were doing
Don Roman’s fall shearing, and any one less
practiced than Lorenzo might have lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
count now and then. Every one seemed to
be working his best, but the two cries that
came oftenest of any were “<i lang="es">trece</i>” and
“<i lang="es">diezisiete</i>.” Number thirteen was a short,
thickset Mexican from Los Lunas, known
(because of his unusually dark complexion)
as Black Juan, and number seventeen was
that two-fisted Pedro of Cubero. They had
been for several years the two best shearers
in Valencia county, and therefore, very
naturally, rivals—though in some way they
had never come together before. But now
finding themselves, on the eve of the fall
clip of 50,000 sheep, face to face each with
a man he had never seen, but had disliked
for ten years, neither could refrain from a
slight curl of the lip. That fellow such a
<i lang="es">guapo</i>? Huh! He might make a noise
among the slowpokes down in the valley,
but beside a real shearer there wouldn’t be
enough of him to make a shadow! It was
not long before their thoughts came to
speech, and soon they had made a wager for
a sheep-shearing race on the morrow. The
ponies upon which they had come, their
tattered blankets and a large proportion of
their prospective wages were staked on
which should shear the more fleeces between
sunrise and sunset.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>For eleven hours, now, the race had been
in progress. Lorenzo had given the word
when the first rim of sun peered above the
yellow mesas. At noon the other shearers
had taken the usual half hour to swallow
the rude meal of tortillas and roasted sheep-ribs,
but Juan and Pedro had worked doggedly
on. The crunch of their shears
seemed never to stop, and against the numbers
thirteen and seventeen the little slanting
marks (each fourth one crossed) had
crept clear across the tally card and Lorenzo
had to start a new line for each of them.</p>

<p>Five o’clock—five-thirty—six—and suddenly
the timekeeper shouted “<i lang="es">Ya ’stá</i>!”
The noise redoubled for a moment as each
man hurried to finish his present sheep,
and then stopped. Bent backs straightened
slowly amid a general sigh of relief. A
hard day, truly. Not a man in the corral,
even down to young Blea, who had not
sheared his sixty or seventy sheep. But
the rivals? All crowded around Lorenzo as
he began to count up.</p>

<p>“M—m—m—twenty-four, twenty-five—twenty-five
tallies and three. Pedro has
one hundred and twenty-eight sheep!” And
Juan? “M—m—m—twenty-seven tallies
and one—one hundred and thirty-six!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Bravo! <i lang="es">Que guapo!</i>” And the evening
air rang with shouts.</p>

<p>“Thou couldst not have done it fairly!”
growled Pedro, with rage in every line of
his dusty face.</p>

<p>“How, fairly, sleepyhead? Have I not
worked openly before all?”</p>

<p>But Pedro went over the fence sullenly
and walked away, muttering to himself.
Only when a couple of other shearers
joined him at his camp-fire did he give
further vent to his feelings.</p>

<p>“Thrice fool that I was,” he snarled, “to
make a bet against that! For clearly to-day
my shears were bewitched and would not
cut well. And you know well the why—it
is that old <i lang="es">bruja</i> of a Candelária who has
given them the evil eye! For yesterday,
as she passed, my dog ran at her, whereat I
laughed, and in the act she turned and
cursed me.”</p>

<p>“Thou didst ill,” said one of his companions.
“All know that she is a witch, and
works all manner of evil to them that offend
her. Why, there was Marcelino, who refused
to give her meat when he killed a
sheep, and straightway she made a mouse
to steal into his stomach, so that it was near
to kill him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>“But I am not Marcelino, then, to go pay
a horse to another witch to cure me. No, I
will have-me-them with her. She shall pay
me for this loss and for the laughter they
have put upon me.”</p>

<p>“What is that, Pedro?” said young
Alonzo, coming up just then and squatting
by the fire. “You wouldn’t hurt the poor
old woman?”</p>

<p>“Who gave you a candle in this funeral?”
snapped the defeated shearer. “That is
what I will do. There are too many of these
<i lang="es">brujas</i> putting spells on innocent folks, and
there’s only one way to cure them—the
way they did in San Mateo last year. We’ll
stone her for a witch. And much care thou,
that thou get not hurt also!”</p>

<p>The two others made no serious opposition
to Pedro’s plan. They had nothing
against the old woman themselves, but
every one knew that such witches were a
great pest to the community—perhaps it
would be a public service to put her out of
the way. Besides, they were rather used
to being led around by the nose by Pedro,
who, in addition to his prowess as a shearer,
was so powerful and reckless that he had
become the acknowledged leader of a certain
class.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Pues</i>, understood! We will go over
presently and give the old hag a shower of
St. Peter’s tears! And thou”—turning to
Alonzo, who was rising to go—“the less
tongue, the less sore bones, eh?”</p>

<p>Candelária lived across the arroyo in a
miserable little <i lang="es">jacal</i> of piñon<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> trunks
chinked with mud, right up against the side
of the great lava flow. She was a sorry-looking
hag; and, on seeing her, the first
thought of much better educated people
than Pedro would very likely have been:
“What an old witch!” She was tall and
gaunt and incredibly wrinkled, but with
such keen black eyes that almost every one
shrank at her gaze.</p>

<p>Alonzo himself was certainly not fond of
her, and probably it would not be too much
to say that he was secretly a bit afraid of
this grim, dark figure in greasy tatters, despite
his year of school in the little mission
at San Rafael. But at thought of her being
stoned to death he felt a sudden revulsion.</p>

<p>“But what to do?” he muttered to himself
as he slouched away from the camp-fire.
“Pedro is bad to meddle with, and no one
here will help me; even Don Roman is afraid
of the witches, and hates them. <i lang="es">Ea!</i> I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
go warn her, so she can hide till the shearers
have gone.”</p>

<p>It was already very dark as he stumbled
over the rocky ground and turned west
along the bank of the arroyo. This was a
deep ravine plowed through the meadow by
the intermittent brook from the snows of
the Zuñi mountains. In summer there was
no stream, but here and there were pools
enough for the thirsty sheep and cattle.
Now there had been rains, and a narrow rill
connected the brimming pools. He found
the white, peeled log which served as a footbridge
from bank to bank, and started to
walk cautiously across it. Midway he
stopped suddenly with an audible chuckle,
turned, came back and shambled toward
the corrals. Something seemed to amuse
him mightily, for at every few steps he
paused to laugh softly. Camp-fires burned
all about the corral, and even far up the
rocky mesa, where the sheep were being
herded for the night; but Alonzo had eyes
for but one. Near an angle of the enclosure
stood a stout post, and not far from its
foot was a bed of embers surrounded with
sooty kettles and frying pans. It was Telango’s
slaughter house and kitchen, where
that greasy gentleman turned twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
sheep a day into soups and joints for the
shearers.</p>

<p>Telango was at the moment absent, and
when he returned to his post a kettle of
mutton tallow that had been trying out
over the embers was missing. That should
have made a pretty row, for the cook was
a touchy autocrat; but, supper being over,
Telango was so sleepy that he would scarce
have noticed it had his whole kitchen been
carried off.</p>

<p class="tb">“Well, are we ready?” asked Pedro in a
low tone of his allies a little after 8 o’clock.
Every one else was asleep, apparently.
The camp-fires had all died down and no one
was moving. Pedro rose quietly and stole
off into the darkness, followed by Pepe and
’Lipe. “Close behind me,” he whispered,
“and with care, for if she hears us she can
hide in the malpaís, where no one could find
her.”</p>

<p>“But perhaps she would not run,” broke
out ’Lipe uneasily, as they neared the arroyo.
“Since she is a witch she might
rather throw a spell on us.”</p>

<p>“Quiet you the mouth, stupid! We have
only to take care that she does not hear us.”</p>

<p>“But I have heard that they need not the
ears, for the evil spirits tell them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let the evil one tell her, if he will!”
growled Pedro. “I would like to see him
keep <em>this</em> from her,” and he picked up a
jagged lava fragment over which he had
stumbled. “Be not sheep! Close behind
me, now.”</p>

<p>Pedro stepped out upon the log whose
white length stretching into the gloom
seemed to rest upon nothing. His teguas
made no noise upon the wood, and he was
midway across when suddenly there came
a stifled oath. His feet flew right and left
and he dropped astride the log with a violence
that shook the breath out of him, and
in the same instant began to slip to one
side. In vain he clutched at the log. It
gave no hold, and lurching over he dropped
twenty feet. There was a tremendous
splash; and then another and another.
Pepe and ’Lipe had followed their leader
downward without even stopping to sit
down first.</p>

<p>The shores here were steep and rocky,
cut deep in a lava flow millenniums older
than that whose jet black miles lay along
the pretty meadow. In the middle was a
long, deep pool wherein the few boys of
Alamitos were wont to swim in summer.
Just now it was not particularly attractive.
During the shearing several thousand sheep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
were watered daily at the head of this pool
and at the shallower one above, and at such
times no one thought of bathing in the odorous
mess.</p>

<p>Any one listening might have heard for
some seconds after the splashes nothing
but a faint gurgle, as of bubbles breaking.
Then there were curious snorts and plashings,
as if that invisible black abyss had
suddenly become the home of a hippopotamus
family, and then a laborious thrashing
about. Presently there was a rattle of
pebbles, mingled with coughs and angry
mutterings, as if some one were trying to
scale the banks.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you come this side, stupids?”
Pedro whispered across when he
had done choking and sputtering. “The
<i lang="es">bruja</i> lives over here—not yonder. <i lang="es">Vamos!</i>”</p>

<p>“But man! We are not crazy! Seest
thou not that she has the power and so
easily has bewitched us? If we go further
we shall find worse.”</p>

<p>“Four times fools! It was only that I
slipped, and you, being scared, fell also.
Come on!”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” answered Pepe and ’Lipe in
a breath. “But even fools know better
than to defy the evil one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>“Come over or you answer to me!”
snorted Pedro, forgetting his caution.
“Cowards that you are, I’ll show you,”
and he started back across the log to get in
arguing reach of the deserters.</p>

<p>But four steps from the bank his feet
again suddenly leaped out from under him
and the log smote him in the back with a
loud thump, and a wild splash flung a dirty
rain in the faces of his terrified companions.</p>

<p>“Uh, uh!” he gasped, coming to the surface
at last. “Kff! Tchoo!” for he had
swallowed a most unsavory pint.</p>

<p>“Ah, ha-ha!” rang a weird, shrill laugh
from the southern bank. Pepe and ’Lipe
crossed themselves and took to their heels,
without thought of waiting for their leader.
It struck a chill through Pedro, too, as he
floundered to the shore and clambered up
the jagged rocks frantically, cutting his
hands and knees. But he hardly noticed
that—all he could think of was the mocking
laugh. Candelária’s laugh! After all, she
was too strong! There was no use fighting
against these witches—just see how easily
she had undone his strength and wit! No
more witch hunts for him—and he scrambled
up the bank in utter rout. Just then
a dark form reached out overhead. Pedro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
did not see it; but in an instant came a
warm, suffocating avalanche which choked
his cry of terror and half blinded him.</p>

<p>“Murder!” he managed to sputter at last.
“<i lang="es">So-cor-r-r-ro!</i>” and he fled to the camp like
one chased by wolves.</p>

<p>“So, thief! Shameless! It was thou that
stole my tallow, then!” roared Telango,
who had discovered his loss just now. “To
anoint that dirty head, eh? Then take
this!” and with a stout cudgel he belabored
the luckless Pedro till the latter broke away
and fled into further darkness. No wonder
Telango had found him out—his great
shock of hair and beard were matted in a
gray, greasy mask, like the runnings of a
cheap candle.</p>

<p>Pedro did not finish the shearing season.
Next morning he was missing from Alamitos,
and a few days later news came that he
was in Cubero. His accomplices had no
explanations to offer for his disappearance
or for their wet clothing, and as for Alonzo,
he “told nothing to nobody.” Only at times
he was observed to drop his shears and
double up as though he had a pain in his
stomach, while his face would become suspiciously
red. Furthermore, he came carelessly
up to Telango at noon with:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, here’s your lard bucket—I picked
it up by the arroyo. And say—if you want
to make candles, you’d better go scrape the
foot-log. Somebody has greased the whole
middle of it!”</p>

<p>“What thing?” grumbled Telango. “Of
the witches, no doubt. And <i lang="es">quizas</i> the same
who anointed Pedro.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Quizas</i>,” answered Alonzo solemnly, and
he walked off without cracking a smile.</p>

<h4>I.</h4>

<p>The end drew near of the longest siege
that was ever in any of the three
Americas. More than a year ago the red
field of Ayacucho had crowned the triumph
of the rebel colonies. The mother-nation
that found the New World, and tamed it and
gave it to her sons, no longer had sons there,
for the very last had disowned her. Mexico,
the first great Spanish kingdom in America,
had turned republic; and so had the
neighbor provinces. South America had
followed suit; for the cry of “Independence,”
premature as it was among these
peoples, then and still so unripe for self-government,
carried contagion, and Peru
itself, the gem of the conquest, the land of
riches and romance, had thrown off the
merciful “yoke” of home to stagger for
generations under the ten-fold worse yoke
of her own corrupt sons. Of all the Americas
that had been Spain’s by discovery, by
conquest and by settlement, there now remained
to her on the continent only the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
space boxed by the four walls of Callao<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>—a
space a mile and a half square. There
the red-yellow-and-red flag still flaunted defiance
to the victorious insurgents; for there
Rodil,<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> “the second Leonidas,” was making
the last heroic stand for Spain.</p>

<p>It was hopeless odds—this fiery loyalist
against all rebel South America. There
was no possibility of reinforcements from
anywhere; no chance of retreat. Cooped
up in what was then the largest fort in the
New World, he saw the land fenced with
the flushed armies of Bolívar,<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> the bay
blocked by the allied fleets. For twenty-one
months he had repulsed their almost
daily attacks and outwitted their ceaseless
stratagems; and for twenty-one months,
too, had baffled the still more dangerous
foes within his walls. Of the two thousand
eight hundred men at his hand when the
siege began, March 1, 1824, over seven hundred
had been killed and more than twice
as many had died of the pestilence. Of the
eight thousand citizens first within the fort—for
all Callao was included by those huge
ramparts—two thousand four hundred had
been sent out to avoid famine, and over five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
thousand had fallen by the plague. The
survivors had no heart left. Almost daily
some new plot to betray the fort was discovered,
and almost daily the “iron general”
gave a row of conspirators to the
musketeers. To war, disease and treachery,
famine added its terrors. Horse meat
and rats were already delicacies; and only
yesterday, a noble invalid had given a plate
heaped up with gold for three lemons.</p>

<p>It was New Year’s eve. That, down
here, twelve degrees below the equator,
meant high summer. All day long the tropic
heat had beaten mercilessly upon Callao,
and now the wan defenders lay sprawled
along the ramparts beside their guns, drinking
the grateful dusk. Here and there
sounded the uneven tramp of the patrol
down the cobble-paved streets, and their
sharp challenge, “<i lang="es">Alto! Quien vive?</i>” to
every one they met. It rang out now, and
the soldiers crossed their muskets before a
tall, gray-robed figure.</p>

<p>“It is I, my children,” was the quiet
answer. “Delay me not, for I go to the
sick.”</p>

<p>“Pass, father,” said the <i lang="es">sargento</i>, and
all lifted their caps, stepping from the
narrow sidewalk to make room for the
priest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>“But what is this?” cried the officer,
suddenly thrusting out his long arm and
clutching something which was about to
fly right between them. It was a thin, pale
girl of ten, hooded in the black manta of
her people.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Que es esto?</i>” repeated the <i lang="es">sargento</i>
more gently. “Dost thou not know the
orders that none shall move upon the street
after dark, since so many drop letters over
the walls to the rebels? Get thee in, for
even children are not exempt,” and he
pushed her back into the doorway from
which she had just burst.</p>

<p>But the child made no motion to obey.
“The padre!” she panted. “The padre!
For my brother is very sick.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Si, pues?</i> Well, go thou and catch the
fraile, then. But much eye that thou come
not near the walls.” And the kindly old
Spaniard led his men off down the street.</p>

<p>By this time the priest had turned the
corner; and when the child came flying to
that street, lo! he was far ahead. But she
kept running breathlessly and at last, where
the dark bulk of the castle of San Felipe
overhung them, she plucked the gray robe
from behind. Her bare feet had drawn no
noise from the stones, and the priest started<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
violently, choking back what sounded like
the beginning of a cry.</p>

<p>He wheeled sharply about with a stern
“What is this?”—but his voice was
pinched.</p>

<p>“My brother—very sick—padre! Please,
your grace, come!” she panted.</p>

<p>“To the devils with your brother!” he
growled, flinging her off. “<i lang="es">Váyate!</i>” and
he was gone before the dumbfounded child
could speak again. She stood a moment
looking stupidly after him, and then, sobbing,
limped wearily homeward.</p>

<h4>II.</h4>

<p>The house, like most of Callao in those
ill days, was little better than a wreck
after twenty-one months of the rebel cannonading.
The dark stairway teetered and
groaned dismally as she scrambled up, and
overhead the Southern Cross blinked hazily
at her through a tattered frame—the insurgent
shells had left little of the flimsy
roofs of the city where it never rains.
Long, ragged strips of bamboo lathing
dangled here and there, and at her childish
tread dribbles of the gravel covering came
pattering about her like uncanny footfalls.
She was trembling all over when she pushed
open a broken door and entered the room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
the rude Moorish balcony of which overhung
the street. There was a hole in the
roof here, too, and the doors of the balcony
had been splintered by a cannon ball. A
twisted rag flared smokily in an iron plate
of grease on a broken chair, and where the
vagrant shadows began to stand their
ground against its feeble rays, some one
was bending over a tattered mattress upon
the floor.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">No hay cuidado</i>,” said a strange voice
as she stopped short, in alarm. “The <i lang="es">sargento</i>
bade me bring a cup of <i lang="es">caldo</i> for thy
brother, seeing thee so much a woman.
For now that there is nothing to eat, he
said, perhaps that would be the best medicine.”</p>

<p>“God pay you!” cried the child nervously.
“And my brother?”</p>

<p>“He drank the broth as one greedy, and
in a moment fell asleep. How many days
makes it that he is sick?”</p>

<p>“Two, señor. Since four days there was
nothing to eat but two crusts of bread, and
those he made me eat.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Pobrecito!</i> He has no more than
hunger. To-morrow I will bring another
<i lang="es">caldo</i>—for even broth of horse gives
strength—that ye may not starve. But
have ye no fathers?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>“Papa fell in San Felipe; and our mother
was sent from the city with many. But us
she hid in the house, saying that the enemy
had no mercy even to the weak. And so it
was; for the women that tried to pass to
Lima the <i lang="es">insurjentes</i> fired upon. And she
never came back.”</p>

<p>“Dogs of rebels! But now I go, little
one. Have heart, for I will look to you.
<i lang="es">Hásta luego.</i>”</p>

<p>When he was gone the child crouched
down by her brother and slipped her trembling
hand into his. The shadows were so
crawly! They seemed to draw back and
then come stealing at her. And it was so
still—only the hail of the sentries, breaking
across such a silence as if they stood guard
over a city of the dead.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Que hay</i>, little sister?” said the boy,
starting up wide awake with the suddenness
of those that are fevered. “The
father? Couldst not find one? But it is all
the same, for God sent us a friend with
food.”</p>

<p>“And he comes to-morrow also,” she
added eagerly. Then she told how she had
followed the priest, but he had shaken her
off with rough words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Ea?</i> How is that? For the fathers
do not so. And how is it thou followedst
him even to the castillo?”</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Pues</i>, for that he went very fast and I
could not catch him. He was at the corner
even when the <i lang="es">sargento</i> let me pass; but
when I came running there he was almost
at the next <i lang="es">cuadra</i>, as if he too had run.”</p>

<p>Vicente suddenly sat up on the squalid
mattress. The smoky wick flung deep
shadows in his hollow cheeks, and he looked
so pale and wild that Lina almost cried out
at him.</p>

<p>“I tell thee, ’manita,” he whispered earnestly,
“I believe not in that priest! Running
so, and so rough to thee! And thou sayest
that at touch of thy hand to his robe he
started and was to call out? There is a
danger, I tell thee!” he repeated vehemently,
striking his thin fist upon the floor
till the impish shadows danced again.
“All is crooked now, when they say the very
captains wait to sell our general. And if the
priests be traitors too——”</p>

<p>“But what to do?” asked the girl, in awe
of this fierce young brother.</p>

<p>“Ay! What to do? For we know nothing.
But something there <em>is</em>, my heart tells
me. <i lang="es">Oyez!</i> Wouldst thou know the padre
again, seeing him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Como no?</i> For it was near the <i lang="es">farol</i>,
and I saw under the hood his eyes, how
shining they were.”</p>

<p>“And his voice, too—no? Come, then,
and we will see who is this father that
curses his children!” And the boy rose
eagerly, though his legs shook under him.</p>

<p>“But how canst thou go out, <i lang="es">hermano</i>, being
so sick?”</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">No hay cuidado.</i> For now it is for our
king against the rebels, and strength I shall
have for that. The <i lang="es">caldo</i> also gives me new
life. <i lang="es">Vamos!</i>”</p>

<h4>III.</h4>

<p>Weak as he was, he drew her down the
tottering stairs and into the dark street;
and there they stood a moment, not
knowing whither to turn. “<i lang="es">Claro!</i>” exclaimed
Vicente, “we will follow as he went—perchance
we may meet him returning.”</p>

<p>But at the very corner some one turning
in hastily from the next street stumbled
fairly over them; and Vicente and Lina and
the stranger went down in a heap.</p>

<p>“Little animals!” snarled an angry
voice. “Are you blind? For a so-little I
would break your bones. Eh? He is <em>who</em>?”
he hissed, catching them by the arms—for
he had heard Lina’s excited whisper,
“<i lang="es">Es él</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>“She says you are the priest that would
not go to her sick brother,” answered Vicente
in a steady voice, “and I believe it, for
you are rough to the weak. But we will find
a padre who is not so.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Márchanse</i>, brats!” said the stranger
in a tone of relief. “But,” he added, turning
and shaking his finger at them, “no more
running after me, or I throw you over the
wall.”</p>

<p>“Have no care, señor padre,” said Vicente,
with sarcastic politeness; and taking
Lina by the hand he hurried around the
corner. In a moment he turned his head and
caught a glimpse of some dark object peering
past the wall. “<i lang="es">Es!</i>” he whispered,
squeezing the slender fingers, and a few rods
farther on drew Lina into a recess of the
wall. He was trembling all over.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Es!</i>” he repeated. “Canst thou not see
that <em>he</em> is no fraile, though he wears the
habit? It is the voice of a soldier and not of
the church. And here! This fell to my
very hand when we all went to the ground
together”—and he held up a crumpled
paper. “But first it is to see whither goes
this father of rebels. Come so far as the
house and there wait me, for it is better
that I go alone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>“But, Vicente—I—I’m afraid of the
<i lang="es">duéndes</i>!”</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Epa!</i> Fear not, sisterling, for the goblins
touch not those that are true. Remember,
it is for Spain!” And pushing
her gently inside their own doorway, and
stooping to kiss her, he hurried down the
street.</p>

<p>Lina dared not climb the noisy stairs to
the deserted rooms. She crouched in the
hall, shivering, drawing the manta about
her shoulders as if with cold, but shutting
her teeth bravely. The shuffle of Vicente’s
broken shoes had already died away; and
it seemed as if the whole world had slipped
past with him. Ages and ages she waited,
till she was ready to scream with fear;
and then she sprang nervously to the door
at a sound in the street. It was only a
patrol shambling over the crazy cobblestones,
but as it drew nigh she was seized
with a sudden access of fear. Between
them stumbled Vicente, a heavy hand on
either shoulder.</p>

<p>“Let him go!” she cried, rushing upon
the soldiers as if to strike them down. “He
is my little brother, and has done nothing.
Only we found the——”</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Cállete</i>, Lina!” spoke up Vicente
sharply. “If only the señor official will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
so good as to take her with me to the general—for
she is quite alone, señor.”</p>

<p>“It is well—come on, little Amazon!” said
the officer, from whom war and starvation
had not dried up all Andalusian humor.
“Snails! But I thought she was to capture
us! March!”</p>

<h4>IV.</h4>

<p>General Rodil pushed back his chair from
the table, and his grave face took on a puzzled
look as the officer and his odd prisoners
were ushered into the room. “The general
who never sleeps,” they called him—for
at whatever hour of day or night, he was
always appearing suddenly here, there,
everywhere. Well masked was the faint
heart into whose depths those gray eyes
did not bore; tiny indeed the slackness
that escaped them. Well might the ignorant
invest him with a superstitious terror—this
man who was really the garrison of
Callao.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Que cosa?</i>” he demanded in a low, clear
voice.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Pues, señor generál</i>,” said the officer,
still standing at “salute.” “This boy we
found in the Street of the Pelicans, as if
waiting for some one. And when we
searched him <em>this</em> was in his shirt.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>Rodil uncrumpled the paper and bent to
read it by the flickering candle. Suddenly
his haggard face turned even paler, and
then a dark flush rose as he sprang to
his feet and took two steps forward. As
suddenly he stopped, and threw at the
children a glance that seemed fairly to
burn them.</p>

<p>“Are there none but traitors?” he cried,
with a choke. “Even to the babies! And
now, my Ponce de Leon!” for the smuggled
note read:</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Todo listo. No mas se espera al comandante
rúbio. Arregla todo de San Rafael.</i>”</p>

<p>[All ready. Only waiting the blonde
commander. Fix everything in the castle
of San Rafael.]</p>

<p>The “blonde commander” could be none
other than Rodil’s dear friend and trusted
officer, in charge of one of the twin castles—a
man whom he had “made” in rank and
fortune. The general’s face seemed of stone
as he demanded:</p>

<p>“Boy! From where is this letter?”</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Vueséncia</i>, I picked it up from a fraile
who fell over us in the street; and because
he had been rough to my little sister, I followed
to see where he would go.”</p>

<p>“Carefully! For when it is between the
king’s honor and traitors, even youth counts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
not! What should a fraile be doing with
letters of the insurgents?”</p>

<p>“For <em>that</em>, I think he was no fraile,” answered
Vicente sturdily, holding his head
erect, though his knees wavered; and he
told all the happenings of the evening,
while Lina nodded an earnest corroboration.
Before he was done, something of
the hardness had faded from Rodil’s face.</p>

<p>“Your <i lang="es">cuenta</i> runs well,” he said at last.
“Give me proof and I will fill your hat with
gold. But if not—if you are old enough to
be a traitor, you are old enough to die one!”</p>

<p>Vicente’s ragged shoulders squared still
straighter. “When I <em>ask</em> you for money,
señor <i lang="es">generál</i>!” he replied proudly. “We
are of Spain, and for <em>that</em> I do it. He that
made as priest went not to the convento,
but into the house 74, Street of the Viceroy.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Hola!</i> <i lang="es">Señor teniente</i>, take twenty men
in the instant and round-up that house,
bringing hither all that are in it; and that
everything be searched. And send the
teniente Ochoa with another file to bring
hither prisoner the Comandante Ponce de
Leon. <i lang="es">Corriendo!</i>”</p>

<p>For twenty minutes “the sleepless general”
walked the room—sometimes apparently
unconscious of the children, and
suddenly flinging at them some question,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
sharp and searching as a javelin. Then
there were reluctant feet upon the stairs.</p>

<p>“It has to report, your Excellency,” said
Lieutenant Ochoa, “that the Señor Comandante
Ponce de Leon is not to be found.
Since the first dusk no one has seen him.”</p>

<p>Rodil struck his forehead; but before he
seemed able to command his voice, there
was another commotion outside, and a group
of officers bustled into the room.</p>

<p>“What is this, <i lang="es">mi generál</i>?” cried one of
them angrily. “Here we are dragged from
the house like criminals! What means this
rat-catcher of a lieutenant?”</p>

<p>“Little by little, gentlemen mine!” answered
Rodil in a suspiciously quiet tone.
“You will excuse the molestation for my
sake, since I ordered it. And now, I beg
you, have the goodness to tell me of a fraile
who entered your house half an hour ago.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Fraile</i>, señor <i lang="es">generál</i>? No priest has
entered the house,” answered the first
speaker, sharply. He was a tall, handsome
officer, upon whom even the shabbiness of a
uniform that had seen twenty-one months’
fighting sat becomingly. “I think your
Excellency might have asked the question
with less violence to us.”</p>

<p>“Ill it fits me to show discourtesy to
such loyal gentlemen,” Rodil replied, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
an added dryness. “And I am glad to learn
that no priest has been among you—for I
fancied, my Señor Captain Baca, that he
might be converting you to the brotherhood.
You would half pass for a fraile
yourself, now that I see”—and in spite of
himself the general’s voice rose ever so
little—“the moustache which was the pride
of the company is shorn off since midday.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Pues</i>—your Excellency,” stammered
the tall captain. “For the heat—and—and—since
time hangs heavily on our
hands, I shaved for a joke.”</p>

<p>“Well edged is thy humor, captain
mine!” The ironic respect had given
place to the contemptuous <i lang="es">tu</i>. “<i lang="es">Ójala</i> we
had earlier guessed thy wit, to ease the
weariness of the siege. Tell me, boy—<em>is
this thy fraile?</em>” The question came like
a bullet.</p>

<p>“I know not, Excellency,” said Vicente,
hesitatingly. “Of that size he was, but his
face I saw not well.”</p>

<p>“But it is his voice!” cried Lina impetuously.
“And had he the hood, I would
know if it is his face—for the <i lang="es">capucho</i>
covered him well.”</p>

<p>“Little animals!” growled the captain,
starting as if to spring at them. But then,
commanding himself, he said sullenly: “Until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
what will your Excellency carry this
farce? Am I to be <i lang="es">burlado</i> by lying brats
of the street? With these gentlemen I
have passed the time since I came off duty.”</p>

<p>“It is true, señor <i lang="es">generál</i>,” declared the
others, who had nervously watched their
spokesman, the ranking officer among them.
“We have all been together since——”</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Alto!</i>” interrupted Rodil sternly. “You
must bring me better witnesses than your
tongues. For by my faith, I would see this
joke of the moustache played through. <i lang="es">Sargento</i>,
search this captain of the wits.”</p>

<p>“For pity, <i lang="es">mi generál</i>! Shame me not
thus!” And the officer fell on his knees.</p>

<p>For answer, Rodil only stretched his
lean finger grimly. The sergeant, awkward
at disrespectful approach to his superior,
laid his hand upon the arm of the
risen captain, and in another moment lay
sprawling upon the floor. Baca was a young
and muscular man; and almost in the same
motion with the blow he sprang at the window.</p>

<p>The dumbfounded privates had no time
to reach him; but Vicente, in a flash of rage,
flung himself at his legs, and the tall officer
crashed upon the floor. Before he could
rise a dozen soldiers were upon him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Rodil, his slender sword quivering at half-arm,
faced the four other officers.</p>

<p>“There is nothing in his pockets, Excellency,”
announced the sergeant.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Claro!</i> For he who changes his face so
soon can as well change his clothing. In
his shoes, then.”</p>

<p>There was a renewed scuffle; but in a
moment a cry of exultation—and the sergeant
dragged a thin, soiled paper from
Baca’s stocking.</p>

<p>“Still given to jests, <i lang="es">capitan mio</i>—that
you walk on the mines which are to blow
the rebels up at the next assault. It is a
clever diagram, and Salom would have paid
thee well for it, I warrant. <i lang="es">Hola!</i>”</p>

<p>For the door let in four soldiers and their
petty officer; and over the arm of the latter
hung the long gray-brown habit of a Franciscan
friar.</p>

<p>“It was between the mattresses of the
señor <i lang="es">capitan</i> Baca,” announced the sergeant.
“And as for these little ones, I am
their witness—for to my patrol passed first
a tall fraile, and soon came running this
womanling after him for her brother, who
was very sick.”</p>

<p>“And the boy is he to whom I carried a
cup of broth—and I found him well fevered,”
spoke up one of the soldiers, scared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
at his own thick voice before the grim general.</p>

<p>“It is enough,” interrupted Rodil. “I
give thanks to God that there are patriots
yet—and eyes in them, too. These children
stay with me. For the Señor Captain
Baca, and for these gentlemen who ‘were
with him all the time,’” he continued with
grim terseness, “sunrise against the wall
of San Felipe. Until then, your heads answer
for theirs!”</p>

<p class="tb">That is all there is to tell of the habit of
the fraile—except that it served for a
shroud to the traitor who had masqueraded
in it.</p>

<p>But already was the beginning of the end.
The desertion of the Comandante Ponce de
Leon, who had dropped over the wall and
fled to the enemy, gave to the insurgents
plans and information of fatal importance.
Then Riera, the other comandante, turned
traitor too, and delivered to the foe the
castle of San Rafael.</p>

<p>Resistance was no longer possible, even
to “the Spartan of Peru.” On the 11th of
January he entered into correspondence
which ended with the honorable and advantageous
capitulation of Callao, January 23,
1826. Of the original 2,800 soldiers only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
three hundred and seventy-six remained,
and a scant seven hundred citizens of all
the former thousands. There was little
left save glory—but of that so proud a
share as was earned by no other man of
either side in the war of the colonial rebellion.
For that matter, history has few
pages like the resistance of Spain’s last fort
in America.</p>

<p>When Rodil, in full uniform, boarded the
English frigate “Briton” to sail away to
the long years and high honors that awaited
him in Spain, he carried with the banners
of his favorite regiments a boy and girl
who seemed less embarrassed by their fine
new dress than by the attention which
everywhere greeted “the little orphans of
Callao.”</p>

<h3>The Great Magician.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 50px;">
<img src="images/deco-chap.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Really know one? Well, I should
say so—better than I know any one
else alive. No, it was not Herrmann, nor
Signor Blitz before him; though each in
turn seemed to my young eyes the most
marvelous conjurer possible, and the latter
remained for years a haunting wonder. But
I was already getting acquainted with a
magician to whom both of these put together
were a fool. For that matter, we
had always been neighbors; but for years
I never really knew him well, nor was even
aware that he was in the conjuring business
at all. Had we boys realized that we were
growing up next door to the greatest living
prestidigitator, he doubtless would have
got a little more attention from us; but he
was very quiet, and not at all given to
“showing off;” and, to tell the truth, we
left him pretty much to himself. Even in
our games he was hardly ever asked to take
part; though I can see now where he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
have given us a good many points on three-old-cat
and follow-my-leader, or any of our
other sports. It makes one feel cheap to
find that one has been living so long next
door to such a genius without ever getting
on intimate terms with him, or fairly discovering
who he is. It was not his fault,
either, for there was never anything stuck
up about him, despite his wonderful gifts.
With some people, it is true, he never was
known to associate; but that was merely
because he did not push himself. To any
one who gave him to understand that his
company was agreeable he was always cordial.
That I call downright obliging in one
who has got so high up in the world—for
he is known and respected everywhere, and
has been invited to appear before kings and
queens when even their prime ministers
were shut out. You see, he has been a
great traveler. Perhaps there is not a
place in the whole world that he does not
know. But, then, it’s easy to travel when
one has plenty of means and leisure, and a
free pass everywhere. Possibly he would
not get around quite so much if he had to
pay fare.</p>

<p>Though it took us so long to get acquainted,
we rather “cottoned to” one another
after the ice was broken, and for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
last twenty years have been great chums.
In that time we have knocked about the
world a good bit together. <em>Really</em>, I mean,
not like our first travel. In the younger
days he used to drop in on me every now
and then with a serious air, and remark:</p>

<p>“Say, want to go to Shanghai this evening?
Well, shut your eyes. Presto!
change! here we are! Now, come around,
and we’ll see the sights.”</p>

<p>And there we were in Shanghai, using
our eyes and holding our noses. But all
that, you understand, was one of his sleight-of-hand
tricks. It was very pleasant and
inexpensive travel, and I learned a good
deal from it; but the grind of it was that I
could not bring back any of the wonderful
things we saw in the bazars. I’d just about
as soon not travel as to be unable to collect
trophies from the country I am visiting.
It was really not his fault, of course.
He is the most accommodating fellow in the
world; but even jugglery has its limits;
and after a friend has given you a trip to
any part of the world you choose, and
brought you back safe and sound, and paid
all your expenses out of his own pocket,
no well bred guest could have the face to
ask him to bring also a cargo of all sorts of
truck. When I used to groan at coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
away empty-handed, he would say frankly:
“Sorry my boy, but it really can’t be
helped. I’m glad to take you anywhere,
and make it as pleasant for you as I can;
but my pass is for passengers only, and the
baggage business is strictly prohibited. It
is too bulky; and then think what trouble
I should get into with the customs officers
if we went to bringing in such cargoes outside
the regular channels.”</p>

<p>In later years we have pretty thoroughly
made up for that aggravation; for nowadays
I am the host, and wouldn’t think of
starting on a journey without inviting him
to come along; and we bring back all sorts
of interesting plunder from everywhere,
until the house we occupy together looks
more like a museum than anything else.
He himself admits that it’s a good deal
ahead of the old way; but even the delight
of collecting—and no boy or man half
knows what life is until he “collects” something,
and earnestly—even that pleasure
would not compensate me for the loss of
his company. He is the very best traveling
companion I ever found; so ready to do
whatever you wish, so full of information,
so helpful in emergencies of any sort.
Some people who have traveled with him
have tried to tell me that he cowardly deserted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
them in time of danger; but there
must be two sides to this story, for I have
seen him in a great many tight pinches, and
he was clear-headed and quick as a wink to
do the right thing. To tell the truth, he
has saved my life a score of times, all by
his dexterity; so you may be sure that
when people talk of his running away and
leaving them in the lurch, I resent the imputation,
and conclude they were the ones
really to blame. In knocking about the
frontiers I have found a good many men, of
several different colors, who make you feel,
“Well, if it came to a fight for life, with my
back against a rock, <em>that</em> would be a good
fellow to have beside me.” But among all
those brave men—all of whom I admire,
and some of whom I love—I would rather
have him by me, in a pinch, than any other
one.</p>

<p>You must not think from this that my
friend is a desperado, or a professional
fighter, or anything of the sort. On the
contrary, his disposition is as peaceful as
his habits are quiet, and he hates any sort
of a row. It is only in the crises which any
man may meet, and every man must sometimes
meet who travels outside the beaten
tracks, when it is necessary and manful to
fight, that he suddenly turns combative and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
pitches in. Ordinarily, he is a plain, practical
business man, who, for his own part,
might have retired long ago, but remains
in the firm for the sake of the junior partners.
He works harder than any of them—and
then, when business hours are over,
diverts himself and his friends by little exhibitions
of his matchless skill as a conjurer.
At such times he likes to forget
work and worry altogether, and to be jolly
and free of care and full of pranks as a boy.
I have seen people so inconsiderate as to
insist on boring him by “talking shop” out
of office hours, but he always resents it.
He is rather nervous and very impressionable,
apt to fall into the mood of those who
are with him; and he sometimes gets so
tired and confused as to show very little of
his usual wisdom. Indeed, I have seen him,
when very weary, make a flat failure of
some trick at magic, which ordinarily he
could do with astounding cleverness.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly his greatest claim to public
respect is in the quiet, every-day wisdom
of his practical career; but his gifts as a
magician are so brilliant and so fascinating
that one naturally thinks of them first.
And, in spite of his long business training,
there isn’t a mercenary streak in him.
Some of his most wonderful performances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
are given gratis, and he even seems to prefer
an audience of one to what the managers
would call “a paying house.”</p>

<p>Eh? You would like to know what he
can <em>do</em> that is so much bigger than the tricks
of the wizards that get their $200 a night?
Well, if I were to tell you all I’ve <em>seen</em> him
do, we wouldn’t be done this side of 1900;
but here are some few things, and if you do
not admit that Herrmann and all the rest
are mere greenhorns to him, I’ll agree
never to go near another of his performances.</p>

<p>I never knew him to fry eggs in a stove-pipe
hat, nor to pick twenty-dollar gold
pieces out of people’s eyes, nor to chop off
a man’s head and then stick it on again, nor
any of those threadbare sensations, though
he sometimes practices simple illusions like
making things appear where they are not,
or causing them to seem not to be where
you really know they are. But those are
trifles, just to keep his hand in; his claim
as champion conjurer of the world rests on
very different accomplishments. For instance,
one of his favorite tricks is to
take a careless fly-away boy and turn him
into a strong, wise man—turn him “for
keeps,” too. I’ve seen him do that a hundred
times, and you will agree that that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
a very useful trick, as well as a very difficult
one. When one sees how smoothly he
does it, one is doubly sorry that he doesn’t
get <em>all</em> the boys up on the stage and experiment
on them; but, of course, a complete
change of personality is a serious thing,
and he would not be justified in taking any
such liberties without the full consent of
the subject.</p>

<p>An almost equally remarkable trick, and
one he is equally fond of, is to take a thoroughly
homely girl and put a brand-new
face on her. Not exactly a beautiful face,
for he says that is none of his business, but
a face that every one likes to look at. Yet
I know girls so foolish as to decline treatment
by this great specialist, and to think
cosmetics better.</p>

<p>My friend’s hobby for experimenting
upon young people, and his innate fondness
for them, as shown by his patience with their
frequently slighting treatment of him, made
me remark one evening: “How is it you
are so good-natured with these rattleheads?
Nobody else would have the patience. Even
when a fellow has snubbed you in the most
discourteous way you seem to bear no
grudge, but to be always ready to do him a
good turn if there is a chance.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said my friend, slowly, dropping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
a new sleight-of-hand he was practicing,
“you see, I was once young and a fool myself,
and had to grow and develop; and the
process was so tedious that I’m not apt to
forget. And, somehow, I feel as if I should
always keep young in spite of the years.
There is always something to interest me,
and that keeps me from growing old.”</p>

<p>“By the way,” I put in, “when did you
begin conjuring? Such marvelous proficiency
as yours can have been attained only
by lifelong practice. Did you take it up
deliberately, or drift into it by chance?”</p>

<p>My friend gazed soberly for a moment at
the crackling cedar sticks in my adobe fireplace—he
had come out to visit me in New
Mexico—before replying.</p>

<p>“Do you know, this reminds me very
strongly of my own early life. These Indians
who are your neighbors, this simple
way of life, recall old times. You might
not believe it, but my own folks were nomad
savages, and my infancy was passed among
scenes compared to which your surroundings
here are highly civilized. Yes, I don’t
wonder you are astonished; in sober earnest,
you cannot imagine how brutal and
squalid were the surroundings. Nothing to
wear, very little to eat, and that little always
raw; in fact, not one of the conveniences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
which even an Indian now deems
necessary to his existence. Why, we hadn’t
even a way to warm ourselves; and as for
houses or clothing, they were quite unknown.
Education? Not a bit more than
the monkeys have. I was nearly a grown
man before I learned to read and write.”</p>

<p>“Why, you have risen even further than
from rail splitter to president!”</p>

<p>“Ah, Lincoln got as high as man can get.
We were very dear friends, and I believe I
helped him materially in the great crises
through which he was called upon to lead
the nation. At any rate, he always consulted
me before taking any important
step.”</p>

<p>Now in any one else, this would have
seemed the end of impudence and mendacity,
if not half blasphemy. But when my
friend the magician said it, I knew it must
be true. He went on in his quiet way:</p>

<p>“But we were talking of my youth. You
asked how and when I first took up conjuring.
To tell the truth, I can hardly remember.
I was certainly very young, and the
discovery of my powers was quite accidental.
One of my first tricks was very
simple; but perhaps it was most important
of all. It lifted my people from a lower
plane than any savage now occupies, to high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
civilization. Every person every day uses
that little invention of mine—and 99 per
cent of them without stopping to thank the
inventor. By simply taking two sticks and
rubbing them together—this way—I produced
a substance which had never been
seen on earth before, but which is now the
first absolute necessity in every household.
If it were abolished, the world’s progress
would stop. It’s a very curious substance.
The materials of which it is composed are
invisible and intangible; but <em>it</em> can be seen
further and felt more than anything else in
the world. You can’t touch it; and yet,
here, if you could not sometimes <em>almost</em>
touch it you would perish. You have to
feed it as carefully as you would a horse, and
much oftener; and, unlike any other laborer
I know of, it will never work between meals.
But while it eats, it will work like mad.
Another queer thing about it is that it would
live forever if you fed it forever; but it dies
as soon as it stops eating. But you can
bring it to life again in a minute, strong and
active as ever. It is terribly mischievous,
too; if you give it proper attention, it cuts
up no pranks; but if you are careless, it sometimes
sneaks off and does more damage in
one short romp than a hundred men could
replace by a lifetime’s earnings. Then it’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
curious what a hatred it has for a still commoner
substance which I <em>didn’t</em> invent.
Bring the two together and there is a noisy
and desperate fight, and one or other of the
combatants is annihilated. Yet if you place
them just near enough to each other, but
so confined that they cannot grapple, they
work together with an energy which I
saw move a hundred buildings once—each
building over thirty feet long. Ah,
you wonder more at some of my other
tricks, probably because you are less familiar
with them; but I tell you that is just
about the biggest single thing I ever did.
There would have been neither geography
nor history; we should never have heard of
Cæsar or Napoleon or Washington or much
of anybody else, if I hadn’t stumbled on
that little secret of rubbing the sticks, while
I was still what you might well call a green,
awkward boy.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I admitted, “I guess, after all,
your fire trick is about the greatest thing
of all—though I hadn’t just looked at it in
that light before. Really, about every single
thing we depend on depends on that.
And that was about your first turn in
magic?”</p>

<p>“Ye-es, perhaps the first important one.
It was a great start, too, for after that I advanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
pretty rapidly in proficiency, until I
became, as you know, able to do pretty
nearly whatever I try.”</p>

<p>That is not putting it too strongly—he
<em>can</em> do almost anything he seriously turns
his hand to. After what I have seen him
accomplish, there are few things I would
deem it hopeless for him to attempt. Our
stage magicians are at their wits’ end to
devise some new trick; but he invents a
thousand a day—the poorest more wonderful
than their masterpiece. Now there’s
his own life preserver, for instance—a ridiculous
little affair in something like thirty
pieces; the simplest thing, yet of almost
infinite uses. It is, among many other remarkable
qualities, the greatest preservative
known. An article so ephemeral that
a breath of air would whisk it away, so
perishable that not all the Arctic ice could
save it, can by this means be kept a thousand
years—aye, or ten thousand, for that
matter—as good as new. Yes, a man’s
very speech may become visible and eternal—all
because my friend once did a little
conjuring for a Greek, who raised most remarkable
harvests from seed our florists
never handle. I don’t know just where it
<em>does</em> come from nowadays—for we still see
that sort of crop once in a while. Perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
Cadmus himself was a politician, and the
dragon’s teeth are an heirloom in the family.</p>

<p>Those early conjurings are not more
astounding than the new ones he is constantly
devising. Nowadays he can sit
down in Washington or London or Berlin,
and, by a few taps on a table, turn a million
men into a machine for destruction. He
will take your ear in New York and hold it
to the lips of your friend in Chicago, and
then make it as easy for the Chicagoan to
hear what you say in reply. Your voice,
which, so far as any ability of yours goes, is
lost forever as soon as spilled, he can bottle
up so perfectly that your great-grandchildren’s
great-grandchildren shall listen to
what you said two hundred years before
they were born, and hear it in your very
tones. You see, my friend is making life a
good deal larger, and death a good deal
smaller—and he is not done yet!</p>

<p>But I should be. There is simply no use
trying to enumerate his magic, for it has no
end. Besides, you can get a much better
notion of his powers by watching him than
thus at second hand from me. But how are
you going to find him, when he doesn’t advertise?
Why, of course! How stupid of
me to have forgotten to tell you that his
name is—Thought.</p>

<h3>The Silver Omelet.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 50px;">
<img src="images/deco-chap.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Doubtless you should not be blamed
for a sniff of incredulity when I come
to mention the size of it, though you certainly
have not made as many omelets as I
did in the years of keeping house on the
frontier “all by my lonesome,” and though
you probably could not turn one now by
flapping it to within six inches of the ceiling
and catching it, t’other side up, in the frying
pan, as every fit frontiersman should.
But blink as you will, it is a solemn truth
that we are now sitting down to an omelet
two feet and a half thick and a little matter
of one hundred and ten feet across! And
worth more than all the food your whole
household could eat in a generation.</p>

<p>The worst of it was that the <i lang="fr">chef</i> was
away. Don Ygnacio, who had served up
these gigantic dishes for thirty years, and
had the knack of them, was to-day in Dolores;
and in charge of the range was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
fuzzy-faced lad of eighteen who had never
turned a Guanajuato omelet in his life.</p>

<p>Guanajuato, you must know, is one of the
oldest and richest silver-mining districts in
the world. Founded over three hundred and
fifty years ago, this picturesque Mexican
city has produced more than a billion dollars
in bullion, and not tired yet. In 1527 a Spanish
miner invented in Mexico the cheapest
and simplest method yet known for reducing
silver ores—the so called “patio process”—by
which the great bulk of the silver of
Mexico and Peru has been extracted for so
many centuries. To this day the haciendas
for patio reduction are among the most interesting
features of the great silver camps
of Spanish America. Each hacienda is a little
walled city—with its strong ramparts, and
corner towers loop-holed for muskets; its
huge sheds for the primitive ore-grinding;
its pleasant offices and home for the <i lang="es">administrador</i>;
its quarters for employes; its stables
for hundreds of mules; and its enormous
stone skillets wherein the hugest
omelets in the world are “cooked.”</p>

<p><i lang="es">Torta</i> in Spanish America is the usual
word for omelet. It is literally a “cake,”
and “of eggs” is implied. But the miners
use it specifically for the omelet of wet-ground
ore seasoned with the necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
chemicals to assemble the silver. In looks
it is simply a stupendous mud pie.</p>

<p>In the hacienda of the Cypresses one of
these omelets was even now cooking. Patient
burro caravans had packed down from
the wonderful old bonanza mine of the Valenciana
enough <i lang="es">cargas</i> of that broken gray
rock to make forty-six “heaps” of 3200
pounds each. The ore had been fed to the
great trundling <i lang="es">molina</i>, whose ponderous,
upright, iron-bound wheel grudgingly followed
the straining mules round and round
its pivot, crunching the rock finer and finer,
till the particles sifted through the screen
to the bins below. Thence it had been
shoveled into the wet-grinding <i lang="es">arrastras</i>—thirty
big stone tubs, around which the
mules circled with their “whims,” dragging
granite blocks which scrubbed the wet
gravel into fine paste. Then the mud went
to the great <i lang="es">cajete</i> (tank), where the surplus
water was “wept away,” as they say; and
finally to the stone-walled, stone-paved
patio, to become a torta.</p>

<p>Almost anyone with eyes could crush
rock, dry or wet; but when it came to
sampling that precious mud, deciding precisely
how much silver it carried to the ton
and how refractory it was, and therefore
just how much salt and just how much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
mercury must be put in for seasoning, why,
then was no time for a greenhorn. Fifty
thousand dollars is no joke, any way you
look at it; and when you come to hunting
for $50,000 by the invisible atom in a hundred
and fifty tons of mud, it is as serious
as anything well can be.</p>

<p>But Don Ygnacio had had to go, and with
four of the trustiest servants, all armed;
for in those days, a generation ago, the
brigands were a fear on every highway of
Mexico. And there was no one to leave in
charge except Alberto, his nephew.</p>

<p>Luckily there had been time to set a
recipe for the torta just turned into the
pan. “So much salt and so much <i lang="es">azogue</i>,”<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
said Don Ygnacio; “that, I think, will suit.
But watch it well; and if not, season it by
the formula. Care, then, and much luck!”</p>

<p>Every day of the seventeen since then,
Alberto had paced the flagging by the patio,
and the passages of the great sheds where
dry mill and wet mill were chewing their
noisy mouthfuls for a new torta, now and
again turning his eye covertly to the last
room on the administrador’s porch, behind
whose heavy door he had heaped the forty-pound
bars of massy silver from the last
omelet. The washing and concentration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
and smelting he had superintended without
much difficulty, and had seen that $49,000
worth of metal safely stored.</p>

<p>So far as the present torta went, his
assays indicated that Don Ygnacio’s hasty
estimate had been precisely right. But he
certainly hoped the old manager would be
back in time to decide if the usual eighteen
days had been enough “cooking”—and,
doubly, to fix the seasoning for the next
omelet. And in all, it was a heavy responsibility
for a boy who had studied a
hundred tortas, but never been charged
with one before; and it was to be noticed
that his shoulders were not quite so miraculously
square as on the first day, nor his
chest so thick, now that he came down from
the arrastras to the patio.</p>

<p>In this quarter-acre mud omelet the beating
and the cooking went on together. A
score of barelegged men and grown boys
waded thigh-deep in the mess, driving their
mules (blindfolded, poor beasts, to protect
their eyes), and holding down the drag-boards,
to mix the mercury and its prey.</p>

<p>It was close to noon. In five minutes the
wading mules would be done with their exhausting
day’s work of six hours. Alberto
walked down toward the well-tower beside
the patio, and something drew his eyes to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
an overgrown lad slouching behind one
white mule at the edge of the mud. Poor
dullard! It was one thing to wade in mud
at eighteen cents a day, and quite another
to manage mud which was worth a comfortable
year’s salary per ton.</p>

<p>“S-s-t!”</p>

<p>Alberto started. Surely it could not be!
Well, it <em>was</em>! This perambulating mudlark
was actually “s-s-t”-ing to him!</p>

<p>“Care!” whispered the Indian lad, as
Alberto came alongside the stone curb. He
looked only at his mule, hauling at the tired
beast and scolding it for some imaginary
offence, and between his objurgations dropping
whispered “asides.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Arre</i>, ill-said brute! (<i>Young Excellency,
the bandits!</i>) For how long must I enshow
thee to walk well? (<i>And some of those in
the hacienda!</i>) Miserable! For what is the
rein? (<i>They are making to rob—to-night!</i>)
<i lang="es">Arre</i>, lazy-bones!”</p>

<p>The stolid face had not once changed;
and now that another driver approached,
he went sus-ushing off through the mud
with never a sidelong glance.</p>

<p>Alberto felt himself grown suddenly pale;
but he was no fool. He glanced at the intruder.
It was a new man from the country—a
tall, powerful fellow with a huge scar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
on his cheek, shifty eyes, and a beak which
had already earned him the nickname of
Narigudo—“Big Nose.” He in turn sent
a sly, sharp look first at the young Indian
ahead, then at the young manager. The
latter was already walking quietly toward
the well-house.</p>

<p>The silver bell in the old belfry clanged
noon. The waders, of two legs and four,
clambered out from the mud. In a moment
blindfolds and harness lay on the flagging,
and the mules, suddenly optimistic, went
braying and scampering out through the
great gate to bathe and drink by the highway
in the little stream which has carried
more precious burdens, doubtless, than any
other brook on earth.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> A moment later
there was a more deafening clatter, as the
hundred mules from the mills came gallopading
down the flags in a very avalanche.
<em>They</em> would have to work six hours more;
but they knew the noon hour. Resistless
as a charge of cavalry, they swept around
the corners and out of the gate in a jam
which seemed sure to kill some of them.</p>

<p>Alberto had laughed a thousand times at
this daily avalanche; but now he saw it
with far-off eyes. He dipped his hand in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
bucket of the pump-wheel and bathed his
head, wherein a thousand or more little
prickles snapped. It was enough to make
anyone’s brain crackle—robbers all about,
accomplices in the hacienda itself, nearly
fifty thousand dollars in the room at the
head of the corridor, and he alone!</p>

<p>This boy had been carefully reared. He
was unused to danger and to responsibility;
and now he was fearfully scared. And yet—well,
he had inherited something from
the men who conquered that wilderness so
many centuries ago.</p>

<p>In five minutes the young <i lang="es">administrador</i>
was making his rounds as usual, now and
then stopping to pick up a sample of ore
and examine it with great apparent interest.
Among the groups of laborers he
passed at lunch he felt, with a little shiver,
that some eyes were on him even more
sharply than they are always on the <i lang="es">administrador’s</i>
back; but outwardly he gave no
sign, as he figured away at very much the
toughest problem he had ever dreamed of.</p>

<p>Suddenly he struck his head, and turned
and walked down to the patio. In full view
of the men he took a careful sample from
the mud omelet here and there, scrutinized
it critically, and carried it off to the assay-room.
In ten minutes he was out again;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
and walking up among the laborers, he
said: “A holiday for all, this afternoon. For
to me the torta looks to be cooked, and Don
Ygnacio should be here to-night, who will
know. Go, then; but at dawn again.”</p>

<p>That was an end of lunch, of course.
The men sprang up with “Infinite thanks,
sir!” and were already making for the gate,
except Narigudo and four others, who
mumbled over their last enchilada, instead
of throwing it away, and looked first at
their mates and then at one another.</p>

<p>“Señor, I do not think it done,” broke out
“Big Nose,” sullenly.</p>

<p>“Who gave thee a candle in this funeral?”
Alberto retorted, coolly. “Answerest
thou to the owner whether there
be loss or gain?”</p>

<p>Narigudo said no more, but rose to follow
his comrades as Alberto disappeared in
the office. When the boy emerged, five
minutes later, the place was deserted.</p>

<p>Rather simple, after all! Only five traitors,
apparently; and for the present <em>they</em>
were gone. Now, just to lock and bar the
big gate, and think what next.</p>

<p>In much more comfortable mind after
bolting the only entrance to the walled hacienda,
Alberto strolled up to the great
shed, and halted a moment by the big trundle-mill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
pondering. So far, so good; and
now what? Leave the place locked, and
ride up to the city to warn the authorities?</p>

<p>A sound that you might hardly call a
sound, so faint was it, startled his tense
nerves; and as he wheeled the blood went
from his face. Fifteen feet away, barefoot,
Narigudo stood in the door of the ore-shed,
with an ugly smile.</p>

<p>“Young Excellency,” he drawled, insolently,
“you have locked me in. Give me
the keys to go!”</p>

<p>At this Alberto found his voice. “In this
hacienda,” said he, steadily, “it is accustomed
to obey the <i lang="es">administrador</i>, and not to
command him. I will let you out when I go
to the gate.”</p>

<p>“Ah, it’s the <i lang="es">administrador</i>, is it? Then
give me the keys before I eat an <i lang="es">administrador</i>!”
The tone had changed from insolence
to rage, and the angry fellow sprang
forward.</p>

<p>Alberto wavered in his tracks, and then
straightened with a snap. The key of the
bullion-room? Never!</p>

<p>He plucked the heavy keys from his belt
and flung them fiercely, just as that big
hand clutched his shoulder. Narigudo
hurled him against the wheel-post with a
curse, and sprawled forward in a desperate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
effort. But the keys, just eluding his
fingers, clanked down into the deep drain.</p>

<p>“Only wait!” he roared. “I shall have it
just the same, and you shall pay the
trouble!”</p>

<p>He plunged into the opening with a backward
glare that made Alberto’s heart stand
still. It was no use to run—he was locked
in, too. Just to wait to be murdered!</p>

<p>But then the boy leaped forward with a
new light in his eyes. A big wooden trough
stood there—uptilted upon one face. There
was a muffled bellow; but he hunched his
shoulder to the mass, and inched it forward,
and sank upon it with a queer, sobbing
laugh. A fine trap for the big rat!</p>

<p>But he had forgotten the difference between
a strong boy’s strength and a powerful
man’s. His seat heaved under him;
clearly, if his weight were removed, Narigudo
could lift it. The fellow had all his
mighty back in play, and seemed like to
overturn his prison door, jailer and all.</p>

<p>Alberto could not even groan. It was impossible
to stay here, as great dangers were
to be guarded against elsewhere. But he
saw plainly that he could not get far before
Narigudo would be out, and——! There was
no weight nearer than the ore-sacks, and he
dared not desert the trough long enough to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
go half-way to them. In a nightmare of
terror he crouched on the trough, trying to
make himself heavy, and praying to all the
saints.</p>

<p>Suddenly he gave a wild shout. The
whim! There stood the great vertical
wheel; its pole, ten feet away, was two feet
from the ground. <em>If—!</em> Thank God, there
was no ore in its path!</p>

<p>Alberto leaped up, dancing noisily on the
trough. He sprang to the floor and back,
ran off two strides, and rushed upon the
trough again. <em>Now</em> his head was clear as a
bell.</p>

<p>In another dash he seized the ponderous
pole and wrenched at it with all his force.
The mill creaked and gave an inch or two.
Back he pounced noisily upon the trough,
and back again to the pole for another
mighty tug; and again, and a dozen times
again. Each time the reluctant wheel
groaned a few inches forward upon its
circle, and now the end of the pole barely
overlapped the end of the trough.</p>

<p>All was quiet below. The prisoner, puzzled
by these crazy antics overhead, was
waiting for a clew to what it all meant.
Now, indeed, he began to heave again; but
Alberto, braced backward on the trough,
was slowly, surely dragging the pole in.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
Another fierce jerk, and his task was done.
The great horizontal stick overhung the
very middle of the trough.</p>

<p>The boy rose with an effort and leaned
against the wheel. A wan smile came on
his lips as the trough rose with a jerk—just
three inches. Then it thumped against
the pole and went down with a bang. The
trap was locked, and Alberto never stopped
till he sank breathless on the office steps.</p>

<p>It was already turning dusk; there was
no time to lose. Muskets plenty were in
the armory, but Narigudo had the key.
However, there was one gun in the office,
and Alberto loaded it with nervous fingers.
Then he climbed into the loop-holed turret
which overhung the gate, and crouched,
waiting. But another thought seemed to
come, for he chuckled and ran down the
court. When he came back to the tower,
twenty minutes later, the stables were
empty, and so was the office drawer from
which Don Ygnacio distributed <i lang="es">cohetes</i> on
the eve of a feast-day. On the other hand,
a hundred sleepy mules were huddled in
the entrance, with a rope stretched taut
behind them, and back of the rope a great
many little heaps of small, red cylinders.</p>

<p>At nine o’clock there was a faint tap
at the gate. “Narigudo!” someone whispered;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
and in a moment, louder and impatiently,
“Narigudo! Art thou asleep?
Open!”</p>

<p>Alberto almost laughed. Then he drew
back his shoulders and said, sharply: “Not
a shot till I say the word! As for you,
stupids, you see the gate! And your Narigudo—he
is well boxed up!”</p>

<p>There was a quick scuffling below. Evidently
the bandits had run back under the
bottom of the tower, puzzled by this turn of
affairs. For half an hour there was a trying
silence; then a sudden rush, and something
smote the gate with a tremendous crash.</p>

<p>“Not yet!” cried Alberto. “Wait for the
word!”</p>

<p>But the robbers were not to be fooled. If
there were really defenders, they would
have fired before now; and again the battering-ram
made the great gate tremble.</p>

<p>Alberto’s finger itched on the trigger.
Should he shoot? Before he could reload,
they might have the gate down. And
then——?</p>

<p>He leaned the long musket against the
wall and crept down into the courtyard
just as the thunderous crash came again.
Evidently the gate was beginning to give.</p>

<p>Another smash, and a leaf of the gate
began to creak with that ominous, growing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
creak that goes before a fall. Just then
there was a little flash in the courtyard,
and a queer <em>s-s-sizz-sizz</em>, pop! bang! <em>Bang!</em>
<em>B-b-b-b-ang!</em> The gate reeled and fell outward,
and with the roar of a landslide a
hundred terrified mules burst through the
gap, trampling and scattering like chaff the
knot of bandits gathered to burst in.</p>

<p>And then from far up the cobble-paved
highway came a stentorian yell, and pistol
shots, and a new clamor of iron hoofs. Two
minutes later Don Ygnacio and his men
swept into the courtyard, where a collapsed
young hero lay beside a vast litter of
bursted firecrackers.</p>

<h3>A Duel in the Desert.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 50px;">
<img src="images/deco-chap.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Of the innumerable tragedies of the wilderness—the
grim procession of life
and death, the irreconcilable conflict of the
animals as bounden as we are to appetite
and passion and self-preservation—probably
every hunter of considerable experience
has seen the eloquent tokens; and every
reader has heard at least of the sensational
cases. The wonder is, perhaps, that these
latter are so few; that only one death out of
a million is so far outside the vast inclusive
rule as to be of interest to us dull-eyed observers.
For the law of conflict is inexorable.
Outside of man and his protected
servitors, only a tiny fraction of a per cent.
of the animals die “a natural death”—that
is, without violence. Of teeming sea and
teeming forest, a vast majority of the denizens
perish “with their boots on”—overwhelmingly
a prey to that insatiate “hollow
feeling” which Nature has put for warder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
of the feral population, lest it overwhelm
the earth. The “defensive” animals fall,
as a rule, to the appetite of their predatory
neighbors; the predatory beasts, in turn,
have a reasonable expectation of death at
the “hands” of their rivals in the tribe,
their foes outside, or the only unnatural
killer, Man. Every acre of field and forest
has had its myriad tragedies of the humble
wild-folk—though we are too unobservant
to note the fact. A few bleaching bones, a
wisp of fur or feathers, a dim scurry in the
dust—this and no more is the chronicle of
the snuffing out of a life as gladly lived, as
hardly parted with as our own. Many authors
have become famous by their skillful
dissection of the Beastliness of Man; but
we too seldom remember (unless while
reading the Jungle Stories or Wahb) the
Humanity of the Beasts, which is quite as
true a part of natural history. This is
mostly because in our civilized cushioning
we know nothing real about the beasts.
They are very little more to us than so
many forms of speech, raw material for
perfunctory literature or for “hunting,”
whose only serious penetration is put up in
brass cylinders by the U.M.C. Co. It is
nothing short of astounding how little the
average “hunter” knows of the game he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
kills, except so much of its habit as shall
enable him to kill it. Indeed, the very name
“Game” is perhaps significant of this blindness.
It <em>is</em> a game, and a great game, if
shrewdly played; but pity the man who
can see in it nothing but the killing! He is
as far from being what I would soberly call
a hunter as the fellow whose only notion of
whist is to play trumps at every lead is far
from being a whist player. One who
knows as well as anyone, and as well loves,
the wild thrill of the chase, who has hunted
and been hunted, and found the keenest
“sport” when the “game” turned the tables
and he had to fight hand-to-hand for
his own life, is not apt to be foolishly
sentimental. But he is very apt to pity
those who have never learned the higher
side of hunting. To watch a beaver colony
at work; or a vixen with her pups; or a
bear family at play; or the wild stallion
herding his flirtatious <i lang="es">manada</i> and falling
like a thunderbolt upon some mustang Lothario;
or partridge or wild turkey at mating
time—<i lang="la">experto credite</i>, it is quite as much
“fun” and rather more woodcraft than
trapping or killing or “creasing.” Which
is saying a great deal. And to such as mix
the game with brains, these things become
more and more the refinement and expertness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
of it. As a matter of fact, a fox is a
much smarter hunter than any man who
hunts only to kill. His eyes and ears are
far better, his nose is a genius of which no
human has so much as an inkling, his foot-fall
is infinitely softer, his strategy far
more competent. For that matter, more
foxes escape the allied force and wit of a
score of men and a half-score of hounds
than partridges or quail escape the unaided
campaign of one fox. As to that, in the
average foxhunt, at least (and leaving out
of the count the trapper and real wilderness
hunter), one hound is worth in effectiveness
half a hundred people. Without a
single dog to lead them, the whole chase
could as soon stay at home.</p>

<p>More picturesque, perhaps, than the
every-day sacrifice of a life to an appetite is
the animal duel to the death; and particularly
when both parties fall. Feral combats—mostly
deriving from sexual jealousy,
for it is comparatively rare that predatory
beasts shall fight outside their kind—are
innumerable, though in a small minority of
cases fatal to either combatant; perhaps
fifty times as rarely to both. Even in the
extreme event, there is generally little visible
record left, and that of a sort that
shamefully few of our hunters can identify.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
The best known—because the most unmistakable—is
the entanglement of buck deer
by their horns in such inextricable fashion
that the duellists starve to death. This is
not so extremely rare. I have found such
grappled skulls thrice—in Maine, in the
Sierra Madre of Mexico, and in Colorado so
noble a duo of elk heads locked in this
Chinese puzzle of death that the inaccessibility
of the range and the impossibility of
bringing out these ponderous relics have
given me a standing grievance these seventeen
years. The swordfish pinned by his
beak to starve beside the pierced hull; the
rat in the fatal nip of a big clam; the buffalo
and the cinnamon bear fallen together dead—all
these I believe to be authentic; and of
the mutual Pyrrhic victory of two rattlesnakes
I have seen the proof.</p>

<p>But beyond reasonable comparison, the
most extraordinary “document” I have
ever seen or heard of in this sort is the absolutely
unique relic found in 1900 by Edwin
R. Graham in the desert county of Inyo,
Cal., near Coalingo, and now in the museum
of the Leland Stanford Jr. University.
There is no possible question of its authenticity.
All the ingenuity of man could not
make a tolerable counterfeit of it. Nor do
I believe there is any reasonable doubt that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
it is the most remarkable record ever found
of a fight to the death.</p>

<p>It is unflattering but typical of our civilized
observation that thousands of people—including
a great many “hunters”—identified
these mummied protagonists as “a
coyote and an eagle.” Even the photograph
shows what they are, as well as the vindictiveness
of their death-struggle.</p>

<p>A prowling wildcat (evidently too hungry
to be fanciful) finds a great horned owl
blinking upon the brink of a cliff, and
pounces upon it, catching a wing hold. The
owl, somewhat armored, even against those
terrible teeth and claws, by its quilting of
feathers, flings itself upon its back; pounding
fiercely with its free wing, tearing with
its hooked beak, and clenching its talons
into the flesh with that peculiar mechanical
lock-grip of its kind—a grip which death
does not loosen, as more than one hunter
who picked an owl up unripe has learned to
his sorrow. That even this large owl could
not kill a full-grown wildcat in any ordinary
combat, probably every hunter knows. But
this owl chanced to get a clutch on the wildcat’s
open fore paw, one of his claws
clinched behind a tendon—and there it still
is, traceable even in the photograph. Perhaps
he could not have withdrawn it himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
had he been the survivor of the
struggle. The cat’s jaws are still locked
upon the broken bone of the owl’s left wing.
Neither is otherwise very badly mangled;
and doubtless the cat would have torn to
shreds “the body of this death” and gone
about his business with no more handicap
than that ineradicable talon in his paw.</p>

<p class="caption">WILDCAT AND OWL IN DEATH-STRUGGLE</p>
</div>

<p>But in their wild and blind mêlée they
overstepped the verge of the cliff, and down
they went together. The 40-foot fall does
not seem to have broken their clinch at all.
If it did, they renewed it. But, though
no fractures were sustained, the stumble
doubtless stunned the cat; and there, irretrievably
grappled in immortal hate, they
died together of thirst and loss of blood.
There at the foot of the cliff they were
found; desiccated by the furnace airs of
the desert, light as mummies, but unbroken;
their very eyeballs dried in their
sockets; the plumage of the owl practically
complete, and enough fur of the wildcat’s
muzzle and paws left by the moths to identify
it even to those who could not recognize
its unequivocal anatomy.</p>

<h3>A ’Rastle with a Wildcat.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 50px;">
<img src="images/deco-chap.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="" />
</div>

<p>One of my very first experiences in
the West was a midnight tussle with
a fifty-four pound wildcat in a lonely cabin
in the Greenhorn Mountains of Colorado. I
shall never forget my horror at the sight of
that huge puss on a beam over my head;
for I had had a serious experience with the
wildcat of the Northeast, and supposed that
this fellow, who was twice as big, was likewise
twice as much to be dreaded.</p>

<p>I did not know that the Rocky Mountain
wildcat is not nearly so fierce, and that he
never attacks man as does sometimes his
cousin of the Maine and New Hampshire
forests; and I had very slight hopes for the
outcome of a struggle twice as severe as
that which a furry freebooter in the Pemigewassett
wilderness gave me a good many
years ago. I need not have worried. The
Colorado Cat was easy game; and when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
last charge in my six-shooter had brought
him to the floor, his life was soon ended.</p>

<p>That first encounter, in New Hampshire,
was more than thirty years ago—years
filled with roving adventure and many other
things which are apt to crowd the past back
into forgetfulness. But I remember it as
though it had been yesterday. Small, white
“exclamation-points” on my chest, with several
other scars, occasionally call it to mind.</p>

<p>I had grown from a consumptive boy to a
small but thoroughly athletic young man.
Wrestling, boxing, canoeing, hunting and
fishing had brought me into good condition,
and every muscle was hard as wire. But
for that fact, I should not be writing this;
for the fight took my utmost ounce of
strength. Had it come a year earlier, my
grave would be in the wilderness to-day.</p>

<p>Of the yearly thousands who visit the
great summer hotels of the White and
Franconia Mountains, extremely few ever
penetrate the Pemigewassett wilderness.
The wild ranges wall its sides, and between
them is a huge and virgin forest, full of
game, dotted and seamed by lakes and
brooks that swarm with trout. In this
almost untrodden wild rises the east branch
of the Pemigewassett, the beautiful little
river which later becomes the Merrimac.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>I was hunting and fishing that spring on
the head waters of the east branch. My
canoe swam a lovely but nameless lakelet,
and my camp, roofed with birch-bark, was
near the shore. There were three brooks
running into the lake noisily; and at the
south end the clear young river slipped
silently out through the dark trees.</p>

<p>It was the last day of May, and still cold
in that mountain bowl. I had a fat deer
hung high beside my shelter; so there was
meat for some time. In a little while the
fishing would be very tame, for there the
trout have not fully learned what a deceiver
man is, and there is little sport in standing
almost astride a rill, and with a five-foot
willow pulling a dozen or twenty fish out of
one pool. But now I knew the big fish were
around, and I determined to spend the day
with my rod.</p>

<p>By ten o’clock I was well over toward
Mount Lafayette, on the largest of the
brooks which came into my lake from the
west; and, descending the steep banks to
the bed of the stream, prepared to fish
down toward camp.</p>

<p>The brook fell very rapidly here, in a
series of short falls, at the bottom of each
of which was a deep, lovely pool of water,
so clear that it seemed only air with a light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
tinge of green. I could see pebbles ten feet
below the surface, and the brown flashes
of the sportive trout.</p>

<p>In five minutes I was landing my first
fish, a game half-pounder, and others bit as
fast as I could attend to them.</p>

<p>There was no need of covering much
ground. I could have caught in fifty yards
all I could eat in a week. But I kept moving
homeward, taking only one or two of the
largest fish from a pool and throwing back
any accidental small ones.</p>

<p>In this way I had gone down, perhaps,
half a mile, when I came to the largest pool
I had found on that brook. Here it seemed
likely that there might be some particularly
large trout. In fact, the first one I struck
seemed to be much larger than any on my
string; but he snapped the hook and was
gone with a splash.</p>

<p>I had drawn an extra hook from my box
and was “ganging” it upon the line, when
some impulse caused me to look up. As I
did so, the tin box fell clattering upon the
rocks and my rod at my feet.</p>

<p>The brook here had cut a narrow gorge
through a ridge, and the pool at whose head
I stood touched on each side the very foot
of a rocky wall nearly forty feet high. I
was standing on a ledge whence the brook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
dropped, perhaps, ten feet into the pool,
and the banks were not nearly so high
there. Still, I presume the tops were fifteen
feet above my head.</p>

<p>A giant pine had fallen across the gorge
from bank to bank, making a knotty bridge,
which was almost over me, but a little in
front; and upon that great log was the
Something which had brought my heart
up into my mouth with such a bump.</p>

<p>On the dark side of the tree, behind the
stump of a huge limb, flat and motionless
as you could press your hand upon the table,
lay almost the last thing in the world
that I desired to see there—a wildcat.</p>

<p>Whether it was crouching there when I
came, or, as is more likely, had crawled out
from the bank to surprise me, I never
knew; but there it was confronting me.</p>

<p>I could just see the fierce glints in its
eyes; and when its gaze met mine, the tip
of the ears, outlined on a patch of sky,
seemed to flatten. My rifle was in camp,
for it was too long a walk to bring it when I
wished to fish. I had not even a revolver—nothing
but a keen-edged, clip-point hunting-knife,
which hung in its sheath on my
left hip.</p>

<p>I hardly dared move, but that knife I
must have. Slipping my right hand cautiously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
behind my back, I reached far
around, till at last it touched the welcome
hilt, and I began to slip the sheath slowly
around my belt to the right side, where the
knife could be drawn less ostentatiously.</p>

<p>All this time I had never taken my eyes
from those of the unwelcome intruder, and
I kept scowling at him with a savage expression
which was meant to alarm him,
but which sadly flattered my real feelings.</p>

<p>How long we stood eyeing each other
thus, I do not know. It seemed an age and
must have been several minutes. Neither
of us moved. He lay crouched and menacing;
I stood outwardly defiant, with my
hand on that precious buckhorn handle.
And then my wet feet, chilled with the icy
water of the brook, betrayed me. I felt a
sneeze working toward the surface.</p>

<p>Now, when <em>I</em> sneeze, it is no gentle <em>tschoo!</em>
but half a dozen or more wild and uncontrollable
explosions, which never fail to
bring tears to my own eyes, if they are
lucky enough not to scare some unsuspecting
stranger.</p>

<p>I struggled to choke that sneeze, to hold
it back; but I might as well have tried to
hold the foaming brook.</p>

<p><em>Ker-cheooo! Ker-cheooo! Ker-cheooo-oo!</em>
With each eruption my head flew down and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
my body shook; and as I straightened up
after the fifth burst, I saw—through the
mist that filled my eyes—something dark
descending upon me like a great, hazy bird.</p>

<p>I had not once changed my position since
first seeing the wildcat. He was a trifle to
my left, and my left foot and shoulder were
pointed up-stream. Our lives hang on such
trifles as that! Now, with the trained
instinct of the boxer—who has first to
learn to act without stopping to think how
to act—I threw my left hand up and out!
Half-way to arms-length it met that furry
avalanche, and broke its force. The cat
landed full against my side.</p>

<p>Its sharp hind claws sank into my thigh,
and the sharper fore claws clutched me in
the pectoral muscles in front and between
the shoulder-blades behind. The pain was
cruel, but I had no time even to cry out. At
the instant I expected to feel those merciless
jaws on my neck, and that would be
the last.</p>

<p>The wildcat knows where the jugular
vein is as well as the best surgeon of them
all; and it is for that that he invariably
jumps. Animals killed by these cruel ambuscaders
are sometimes left whole and
unmangled, save for that wicked little gap
at the side of the throat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>But my boxing lessons had saved me.
As my left hand went out in that “straight
counter,” it struck full in the throat of the
cat; and with the swift inspiration of desperate
men, I clutched the folds of fur
there with all my might.</p>

<p>The cat strained hard to pull-in to me—and
that was a cruel leverage it had in my
own flesh. But my arm, never a weak one,
was doubly strong now; and, though I
could not force him from his hold, I kept
his head well away from mine, which I
“ducked” to increase the still unsatisfactory
distance.</p>

<p>Then, drawing the keen six-inch blade, I
drove it against his side. His left side was,
of course, the one exposed to me; but we
were so “mixed up” that I could take no
accurate aim at his heart, and just thrust
blindly and madly at that stretch of mottled
fur.</p>

<p>Nothing will ever dim my recollection of
that desperate struggle; and yet I seemed
in a sort of trance. You have had nightmares,
wherein some savage beast pursued
you, and you slammed vain doors on him
which he brushed open, and fired ineffective
rifles at him whose diminished pop did not
affect him in the least; and, do what you
would, nothing availed against that implacable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
danger. So it was with me. I seemed
under a spell.</p>

<p>Those awful claws were tearing me everywhere;
that fatal head was struggling to
break down my tiring arm; and the desperate
thrusts of the knife with all the
force of my right arm seemed not even to
penetrate the tough hide. They went deep
enough, as I found later, but at the moment
I was sure they hardly scratched him.</p>

<p>Since that day I have been through a
great many of the things of whose suspense
we say, “They seemed eternities,” but
never one, I think, that seemed so endless
as that. And yet it could hardly have lasted
a minute. I was growing very weak. Blood
was running down in my boots, and my
weary left arm was no longer rigid. My
right was no longer fully under control,
and once, when the knife glanced a rib, it
nearly flew from my hand.</p>

<p>Once, too, I struck high, and the cat caught
my right wrist between his savage teeth
and tore out a piece. Was he invulnerable?
I began actually to believe so—to fancy
that, after all, it must be a hideous dream.</p>

<p>You may imagine from that into what a
state my mind had come. But still I plied
the knife, and still with cramped and trembling
arm held off the creature’s jaws.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>And then, on a sudden, a great wave of
joy swept over me, and I yelled madly.
The curving claws, set deep in my back
and breast, relaxed. It was only the least
bit in the world, but I could feel the exquisite
pain of that slight withdrawal; and
in another instant they came out altogether,
and my foe fell limp upon the rocks
beside me, where he never moved again.</p>

<p>I looked at him once; my eyes grew dim,
and I fell across him.</p>

<p>When I recovered consciousness, we were
lying in a heap, wet with our common
blood. I crawled a couple of feet to the
brook, and the icy water revived me, so
that at last I could rise and limp about the
field of our strange battle.</p>

<p>The cat was a mass of wounds; and as
I counted the eleven fatal thrusts, I
marvelled at his vitality and pluck—and
very heartily respected them, too. Any
one of ten of them would have finally
killed him, but he had kept his hold to the
very last, which had sunk deep into his
heart.</p>

<p>And such a small beast to attack the lord
of creation! I do not think he weighed over
thirty pounds; but what a model of compact
strength and agility! His skin was
so slashed as to be absolutely unsavable;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
but I kept his scalp a long time, till the
moths destroyed it.</p>

<p>As for myself, I was in little more attractive
shape than he. Of my stout duck coat
and trousers only the right half remained.
My duck vest and heavy flannel shirt
boasted little but a few shreds two-thirds
of the way around my body. I was half-naked,
and my breast, back, left side and
left thigh were laced with deep, bleeding
gashes.</p>

<p>There is only one thing about that day
which I do not remember; and that is, how
I got back that ten miles to camp. But
somehow I got there; for when I awoke
next morning, very weak and stiff—for of
all wounds I know of none so painful as
those inflicted by a cat—I was under my
roof of birch bark, and a spotted scalp lay
on the sand beside me.</p>

<h3>A Tame Deer.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 50px;">
<img src="images/deco-chap.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Buck deer, at certain seasons, or when
wounded, may be very ugly customers;
and in hunting East and West, I have
had several unpleasant experiences with
them. The very first deer I ever killed, up
in the New Hampshire mountains, came
wonderfully close to killing me—after his
hind leg was broken at the hip and I thought
it was quite safe to close in to finish him.
How he literally “wiped the ground” with
me!</p>

<p>Others of his kind have given me trouble
and danger in varying degrees, and in a
variety of ways; and I have known several
persons killed by them. But the “closest
call” a deer ever gave me, and one of the
most terrible struggles in all my hunting
and wandering, befell me in the heart of
the city of Los Angeles; and the hero was
a “tame” buck.</p>

<p>It was many years ago, at a time when
my passion for pets, always strong, had
unusual opportunities for gratification in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
one of the moss-gathering intervals of a
usually rolling stone. Behind the house
(where a half-million dollar block stands
to-day) was a good-sized yard, for a city lot,
well shaded with eucalyptus trees, and with
a substantial shed. Here was plenty of
room for pets, and we acquired a variety of
them.</p>

<p>First in our affection was my precious
old cat Beauty, which had come with the
family from Ohio. There was also a horse,
which boarded at the livery stable; and a
fine Danish hound that had adopted us.
This did very well for a while. But during
a vacation run over New Mexico, I wounded
a young eagle; and, seeing that his wing
would soon heal under proper care, I brought
him home and kept him in a leash on the
back porch, where he throve admirably.</p>

<p>Then someone presented me with a barn-owl,
and he kept the eagle company. Rabbits
have always pleased me; and presently
I made some hutches, and in time had them
peopled with a dozen rabbits and guinea-pigs.
In a cage in my study lived a couple
of handsome rattlesnakes; and one day I
brought home in a slatted box a tiny wildcat—at
which a patient wife cried:</p>

<p>“Don’t get anything more, Charlie! We
can’t move now without stepping on a pet;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
and they are too much care for me, with
you gone at the office all day and almost
all night!”</p>

<p>But in spite of herself she grew very fond
of the wildcat baby, which would lie in her
lap and purr with the most ridiculously
disproportionate voice. It could hardly have
been a month old; and had I been the
hunter who found it in the Sierra Madre, it
should never have been taken from its
fierce mother at such an age—for it had
not been weaned, evidently.</p>

<p>Its body was not as large as that of a
lean house-cat, but its legs were quite one-half
longer, so that it had rather the
appearance of being on stilts—and very
uncertain, wobbly ones, too. Its feet were
twice the size of Beauty’s, and its voice, in
growling, was so heavy and so savage that
one could scarce believe it issued from that
ungainly little frame.</p>

<p>It was very gentle with its mistress,
purred sonorously whenever she petted it,
and went stumbling all over the house at
her heels. Nor was it hostile to the young
lady who completed our family, not half so
afraid of Beauty as Beauty was of this wild
cousin. But with me it would have nothing
to do. As I was then city editor of the
morning newspaper, and was very little at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
home, it evidently looked upon me as an
interloper, and at a glance of me would
snarl and show fight as sincerely as a
grown lynx. And it was an enemy not
altogether to be laughed at, as there are
still scars to testify.</p>

<p>Once it climbed up and hid among the
springs of my bed, and the heavy buck
gloves I put on for the task of dislodging
it did not save me from ugly tastes of those
keen teeth and claws. Perhaps it is quite
as well that Tiger did not survive his
infancy, but died of congestion at four or
five months old. Had he grown up, without
a change of heart, he might have become
troublesome.</p>

<p>With this much of a household on our
hands, we might very reasonably have been
content; and so probably should have been
but for one of those “chances of a lifetime”
which are always befalling the enthusiast.
A fellow down in the Mexican
quarter of the city had a pet deer, and,
learning of my hobby, pestered me to buy—“dirt
cheap, Sir!”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t want any deer. Couldn’t
take care of him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but he is such a beauty, Sir, and
tame as a sheep, and $10 is nothing. Just
come and look at him!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, it could do no harm to go and look at
a pretty animal; so I went—with a virtuous
resolve not to acquire another single pet.</p>

<p>The result was what might have been
expected. He <em>was</em> a beauty. There is
almost nothing handsomer than a perfect
Black-tail, and this was an excellent specimen—full
grown, though young, with one
fork on his dagger-sharp antlers, and
gentle as a kitten. The first look of those
liquid eyes made my resolution tremble;
and when the lovely creature came and
nestled his face into my vest with perfect
confidence, I was lost.</p>

<p>I could not even wait to send an express-man
for him. “Here is your $10,” said I;
“and now give me a rope to lead him home.”</p>

<p>The rope was put around that graceful
neck, and I started off in high glee. He
followed me like a lamb through the back
streets, paying little attention to people or
wagons—for he had passed most of his
life in the city—and much less abashed
than his new master by the sensation we
created. Once safely at home, I gave him
a strong leather collar and a long steel
chain, the other end of which hooked into
a staple in the side of the shed.</p>

<p>Bonito, as we named him, seemed very
content in his new home. At night he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
a comfortable bed in the shed, and by day
his place outside. There was plenty of
alfalfa and young wheat, which we had cut
for him from the rabbits’ patch, and bread
and sugar from the house; and every morning
my habit was to loose his chain and let
him wander about the yard with me.</p>

<p>He had a great curiosity about the rabbits
and the owl, a fair understanding with
Giallo, the dog, a supreme contempt for
the little wildcat—which had been transferred
to a big cage in the yard and roared
at us whenever we approached. As for the
three human members of the family, he
was hail-fellow-well-met with us all. He
kept putting himself forward to be petted,
delighted to be scratched behind the ears,
and would rather eat from our hands than
from his trough.</p>

<p>For five or six months Bonito was the
pride of the family. He had grown very
fat, and was sleek and handsome as one
could wish. But with the advance of summer
he turned misanthrope. He began to
paw a considerable hollow by his post, and
now and again stamped his hoof on the
ground with that peculiarly audible rap
which with wild deer is an alarm-signal
sufficient to stampede a quietly grazing
herd. Then he began to show some contempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
for being petted, and several times
pushed us away in a manner nothing short
of rude.</p>

<p>At last I came home one night to find my
wife much worked up. She had gone out
that afternoon to feed Bonito and was giving
him an apple, when suddenly he lowered
his head and sprang at her. Luckily the
sharp horns passed either side the slender
waist, pinning her against the shed, but
not hurting her; and with much presence
of mind, instead of fainting or screaming
or struggling, she scratched beneath his
ears soothingly, and he at last let her
escape unharmed.</p>

<p>“H’m! Well, don’t you go near him
again,” said I. “I’ll attend to him myself,
if that’s his temper;” and I forthwith procured
a new chain.</p>

<p>Several times in the next few weeks he
made lunges at me, but again would seem
gentle and would enjoy a petting. Against
my wife, however, he appeared to have
taken a sudden grudge, and would tug on
his chain at sight of her.</p>

<p>One Saturday she went to visit friends at
the beach, and I was to follow on the half-past
eight train next morning. It was four
o’clock in the morning when I saw the
paper to press and came home, and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
seven o’clock got up to care for the pets
before leaving.</p>

<p>When I went out to the yard, the deer
was not there. The staple was torn out,
and the drag of the chain enabled me to find
where Bonito had jumped the fence and
made off. I trailed him several blocks, and
at last found him impudently grazing on a
handsome lawn on Hill Street.</p>

<p>He did not attempt to elude me, and
when I took the end of the chain he followed
as meekly as you please, only stopping now
and then to nibble a bit of grass by the
sidewalk.</p>

<p>Unluckily just then I pulled out my
watch. Seven-fifty! Time to hurry up—and
when Don Bonito stooped to graze, I
leaned back on the chain and brought him
along. Five or six times this happened,
and I fancied he was not quite so meek.
Hungry he could not be—it was just his
stupid notion to take a bite by the wayside;
and my train would not wait for that. So
each time that he halted, a steady but resistless
pull brought him sliding forward,
brace his feet as he would.</p>

<p>The last time I pulled there was a surprise.
For an instant he held back with
all his strength, and then, suddenly hunching
his body like a panther, he gave a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
bound at me. Losing balance at this sudden
yielding of the weight, I sprawled on
the sidewalk, and Bonito pounced upon me
like a cat, cutting my leg with his sharp
hoofs, and aiming his sharper horns at my
ribs. It was as well that he had to do with no
novice at catch-as-can wrestling, for without
those years of keen practice I never should
have come out from the next fifteen minutes—if,
indeed, from the first onslaught.
As it was, I clutched a horn at the first
pass, within six inches of my side; and then,
capturing the other, readily got my feet.</p>

<p>This head-lock counter-balanced his 20
pounds’ superiority in weight, but the very
fact of being overpowered made him beside
himself. He began to fight with inconceivable
fury, twisting till he seemed like to
break his neck in the effort to free his
horns or get at me with his feet.</p>

<p>It began to appear that he had me in
something like a “box.” It was equally
out of the question to let him go or try to
lead him farther. Every motion or snort of
the infuriated animal showed that his one
thought now was not escape, but revenge.</p>

<p>Still, confident in my muscles—like steel
yet from a thirty-five-hundred-mile walk
across the continent—I had no apprehensions.
The only thing necessary was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
take him home in such fashion that he
could not hurt me; and once there, the
chain would take care of him.</p>

<p>So I got my left arm locked in a chancery
hold around his neck, my right hand still
firmly holding his right horn, which worked
uncomfortably close to my stomach, and
thus, lifting him so that his fore feet were
off the ground, I started homeward.</p>

<p>But there had been a reckoning without
the host. The first two blocks went fairly,
though in an unceasing violent struggle—rather
to the scandal of the two or three
passers we met, so early for Sunday morning
in that quiet part of the town. But
when I came with my prisoner to Fifth
Street, it was with the consciousness that I
was pretty well worn out, and that he, in
spite of the strangle-lock, seemed to be
growing fresher.</p>

<p>Each moment he fought with new rage
and vigor, sometimes driving me against
the fence, sometimes over the curb; lunging
fiercely with those sinewy hind-legs,
and striking wildly with the pointed fore-hoofs,
whose dangerous effectiveness every
hunter knows.</p>

<p>The way we wrestled and fought over
the next six or seven hundred feet might
have been amusing to bystanders, but became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
terrible to me. It was not for the
bruises and gashes I got, nor for the
breathless thumps against fences and
trees, nor for the being violently thrown
several times. I kept his head in chancery,
and these small hurts were not much more
than one expects to get in a good bout of
catch-as-can with a human adversary.</p>

<p>As long as I could keep that deadlock on
his neck I was perfectly safe from any
serious injury, but the grim certainty confronted
me that I could not keep it much
longer. My arm began to give at his
fiercest lunges, my breath and heart were
alike stampeding, and I felt creeping over
me the dizzy faintness of utter exhaustion.
Never had wrestler given me such tussle
before—though I have worked two hours
“on the carpet” at a bout.</p>

<p>Down we went again at the last corner,
and again a glancing hoof cut me as I
fought back to my feet. I dropped the
horn and clasped the left wrist with my
right hand, drawing the arm tighter under
the brute’s throat, at once to hold him
surer and cut off his wind. But the broad
leather collar seemed to save him. A burly
fellow passed. “Help me with this deer!”
I panted; but he looked at the savage
struggles of Bonito and hurried on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>At the very gate the beast bore me down
once more; but once more I struggled up
and dragged him in. We swayed and
fought along, tearing up the gravel-walks
and flower-beds, and at last came to the
shed. I could barely stand, and Bonito
dragged me hither and yon. My eyes were
hazy, and the cramped arms began to slip.
Would Virginia never come? I yelled again,
and just then she came running out.</p>

<p>“Fasten—his chains—around the post!”
I had just breath to gasp; and, like the
brave girl she was, she did it—in what
seemed to me forever, while the deer and I
fought the last bout.</p>

<p>“Run!” I cried, when the chain was at
last secured; and when she was in the back
door, I dragged Bonito to the end of his
chain, loosed my hold and fell backward.
I am positive that I could not have held him
twenty seconds longer to save my life.</p>

<p>He slacked back on the tether and hurled
himself forward till the steel links cracked
again, and his eyes fairly started with the
pressure on his throat. But the chain held,
and his frantic efforts, which continued as
long as I was in sight, were in vain. Had a
link parted then, he would have had an easy
victim. A few minutes’ breathing-spell
made me over, and by a bit of good fortune<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
I caught the next train, and reached Long
Beach not far behind time—though with
various large rents and blood stains on my
clothing.</p>

<p>The next day a butcher was summoned
to rid us of so dangerous a pet. He dealt
Bonito a fearful blow on the forehead with
a hatchet. The deer dropped as if shot,
and lay motionless; and the butcher stepped
forward with his knife. But like a flash
the brute was on his feet again—and on
his assailant, whose coat was pierced front
and back by the sharp antlers. It was a
remarkable chance that they had not entered
his abdomen.</p>

<p>The butcher’s fat, rosy face turned a
sickly gray. He kept his distance after
that, and with a long-handled ax made
thrice sure of the game before he would venture
again within the radius of that chain.</p>

<p>Bonito dressed one hundred and fifty-six
pounds—so you see he was no feather-weight
for a wrestler. He was fat, and
they said very good venison. At home we
could not think of eating the meat of a
former pet; but after his exploits, our sentiment
did not go so far as to make us
sorry that someone else could.</p>

<p>And since then I have never had an ambition
to get another “tame deer.”</p>

<h3>The Rebel Double Runner.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 50px;">
<img src="images/deco-chap.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt="" />
</div>

<p>When I was a lad in a lonely New
Hampshire village, in the memorable
year of 1863, a great many fathers and
uncles and older brothers were off at some
fearful and dimly-comprehended distance,
dressed in blue, and, as we reckoned it,
fighting battles daily.</p>

<p>How brave they had looked one morning,
as they left town, marching with fife and
drum along the crazy sidewalk, and off
down the “Depot Hill!”</p>

<p>After that, the games at school and after
school took a decidedly warlike tinge.
Wooden swords and muskets largely
usurped the place of top and ball; and
proud was the small boy whose grand-dad
would lend him a real sword of 1812, or an
ancient militia shako.</p>

<p>When the stern New Hampshire winter
came on, with its sleighing and coasting
and skating, military evolutions were somewhat
curtailed—but not altogether. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
were snow forts and snow battles; white-blocked
Sumters that defied the assault of
the enemy.</p>

<p>Patriotic feeling ran riot; and when one
young school-fellow, named Tip, espoused
the Southern cause for fun, and began to
press our ramparts sore, gaining recruits
every day by his sheer audacity, there
came to be snow-balls slightly thawed and
then left out over night to turn to ice—and,
as a result, some dangerous casualties on
the battle-field.</p>

<p>The very opposite of Tip in many ways
was Mat Marks. Tip was restless, sometimes
reckless, always full of mischief, but
one of the squarest and least self-conscious
of boys. His sudden “turning Rebel,”
when he could hardly draft rebels enough
to make the holding of our forts against
them half-way interesting, was from no
lack of as good patriotism as ours.</p>

<p>But Tip liked excitement, and was less
vain than most of us; and without a second
thought of any prejudice that he might
excite because of this boyish enterprise, he
abandoned the fort and took command of
the enemy—“just to make it interesting.”</p>

<p>And, though he was always overwhelmingly
outnumbered, interesting enough he
made it for “Us Unions” before he finished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>Mat, on the other hand, while in a way
as active and enterprising as Tip, was
much bound to the traditions—not from
any principle or understanding of them,
but because he liked to be on the popular
side, and at the head of it, too; for he had a
remarkably good opinion of himself.</p>

<p>Thanks to his diplomacy, he counted
more followers than any other lad in town,
and was fully satisfied of the justice of his
preëminence. He liked to deem himself
“a born leader of men,” such as he read
of; and I have often wondered, since, that
we so long and so unquestioningly obeyed
his smooth dictatorship. He was always
“organizing”—the snow-ball battles were
the outcome of his genius—and we carried
out his orders with remarkable fidelity.</p>

<p>With the twentieth of December came a
three-foot fall of snow, and in a few days it
was hard packed on every highway, like a
squeaky, white pavement. No more skating
now—the sled was to be king for the next
two months. For a few days everybody
coasted, hit or miss; and the long slide
swarmed like an ant-hill going crazy. But
then the administrative mind of Mat began
to work. Everyone sliding down hill on his
own hook and straggling back at will—this
was altogether too puerile and unorganized!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>So Mat called a council of war.</p>

<p>“Say, boys,” he said, “I’ll tell you what
let’s do! Instead of going higgledy-piggledy
at it, like a lot of girls, let’s
organize the coasting in good shape. We’ll
have our rules and signals and right of
way, just like a railroad, and a switch at
the tannery corner so the small boys can go
on to the toll-bridge, carrying supplies for
the army, and the express-trains can turn
off to the depot and take troops to the front.</p>

<p>“Then, too, I think father’ll let me have
old Nell, and we can make her haul back all
the sleds in a string, and let fellows have
turns riding her down to meet us again.
So that’ll get rid of the meanest part of it—the
pulling our sleds up hill. Besides,
we’re all the time having trouble with
teams now; but if they all knew we were
coming down in a steady string, they’d
keep out of the way, and do their sledding
only when the coast was clear. What do
you fellows think?”</p>

<p>“Good enough!” “That’s the way!” “All
right!” cried the crowd, in various voices,
but with one mind. But when the exclamations
were over, Tip tilted his sharp face a
bit and said:</p>

<p>“Well, what are you going to do while
Nell is getting down hill? Sit in the snow-drift<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
there at the depot and rub your ears?
Strikes me it’s better to turn around and
climb back, and keep warm, ’stead of waiting
there half an hour to freeze. And
s’posing some team that didn’t know about
our all comin’ down together was to get in
the way? Then we’d be apt to get tangled
up with each other and go to smash.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” retorted Mat, sharply; “I guess
you’re scared. But you don’t have to join
us. If the rest say to go in, I guess we can
get along without you. What do you say,
fellows? Shall we do it?”</p>

<p>“’Course we will!” was the chorus; and
Mat looked triumphantly at his rival—for
there was no denying that Mat reckoned as a
rival, and therefore a foe, anyone who didn’t
agree with him, as Tip generally did not. Tip
returned the glance coolly and answered:</p>

<p>“Why, you fellows do as you like, of
course—I ain’t bossing you. But you can
count me out from any such goose-tag as
that.”</p>

<p>“We wouldn’t have you anyhow!” cried
Mat, nettled at this comparing them to a
flock of geese waddling one after the other.
“We don’t care to have any traitors in our
crowd.”</p>

<p>“Yah, you old Rebel!” piped little Bill
Burpee, taking his clew as usual; and several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
others echoed what was then the most
dreadful word in our vocabulary.</p>

<p>“I ain’t a Rebel, and you know it!” Tip
answered, warmly. “I guess my father’s
fighting as hard as any of yours—and he
ain’t staying home to tend grocery stores,
like Mat’s!” with which parting shot he
walked off scornfully and quite alone.</p>

<p>I can hardly understand now why we
were so unjust to Tip. He had more in
him than any other boy among us, was less
selfish, more trustworthy and a better
friend than ten Mats, and had done each of
us no end of boy-kindnesses, instead of
using us as cat’s-paws for his own ambition.</p>

<p>But just because he had “played Rebel”
for a few days solely to put a little life into
the war, the boys were “down on” him.
His followers in that campaign we made no
note of and harbored no grudge against.</p>

<p>Perhaps there was wounded vanity in
the recollection how nearly his superior
generalship had routed our superior forces.
So unreasoning are early prejudices that I
presume a few of us never did quite get
the last grain of grudge out of our heads—unless,
perhaps, fifteen years later, when
Mat was clerking in his father’s store, and
word came of the death of Capt. Tip in
Arizona. He was slain by the Apaches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
after an heroic fight which saved an immigrant
party till the arrival of troops enough
to scatter the red fiends.</p>

<p>Well, Mat’s plan progressed famously.
A small army of us, with brooms and
shovels, worked over that mile and a half of
road till the coast was in such good shape
as no one ever dreamed of before.</p>

<p>The weather stayed obstinately cold; so,
under Mat’s direction, we brought water
by the bucketful and wet down the safer
parts of the slide. There was some friction
about this, for the older people objected to
so much glare ice; but Mat compromised
by not wetting the street crossings, and
only a narrow track at the side of the road,
so that sleighs had plenty of room without
encroaching on our slide.</p>

<p>At the tannery corner we made a crescent
of hard-packed snow, with sloping concavity,
which rendered it rather easier to
turn that dangerous angle. It was like the
raised rail on the outside of the railway
curve, or the “saucer-edge” of an automobile
race-track.</p>

<p>And then came the marshalling of the
clans. Our embryo Napoleon, of course,
was commander-in-chief, and his pride, the
double-runner “Avalanche,” led the line.
There were in those days but half a dozen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
other double-runners in town. These were
owned by young men. Mat’s was the only
one in “our crowd.” It was a very fancy
affair for then and there.</p>

<p>Right-hand-man Hunt was privileged to
manage the rear, and the coveted remaining
seats were occupied by guests of passing
invitation.</p>

<p>It was no small social power to control a
double-runner, and Mat made the most of
it, giving rides to all his friends with great
princeliness. But I remember that we
never saw on Mat’s “traverse” any of the
urchins from the lower end of the village—they
had no “influence.”</p>

<p>Behind the “Avalanche” came sleds of
all sorts and sizes. As for Tip, no one had
seen him for several days. He lived up on
the other hill—a hill even steeper than
Dolloff’s, but coming in with such an ugly
turn at the engine-house that no one coasted
there since big Ned Green broke his neck
on a wood-pile around the bend.</p>

<p>The great Saturday came for the formal
inauguration of the Cannonball Railroad.
Sixty-odd boys were gathered at the top of
Dolloff’s Hill. Some girls were there, too,
with their high, flat-runnered sleds, upon
which we looked with supreme scorn.
Kitty White and Annie Waters and May<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
Thurston were comfortably tucked up on
the cushioned seat behind Mat on his
double-runner; and Hunt was holding back
on the tail-board till the signal.</p>

<p>“All ready—go!” yelled Mat. Hunt
sprang to his seat, and the sled slipped
away, gaining momentum swiftly. Charlie
White flung himself on his long cutter and
was at its heels; and one after another, in
continuous line, the whole array of boys on
their sleds went sweeping down the hill.</p>

<p>Just as the last of us were whizzing by
the engine-house, there was a shrill yell,
and a dark flash from the other arm of the
“Y” of the roads shot alongside in a swirl
of snow-flower, and was past almost before
anyone could crack a wink.</p>

<p>All we were sure of was that Tip and a
party had gone by us, but how, or on what,
no one knew. Anyhow, it was just like
him. No one but Tip could have turned
that lopsided corner in that way, and grazed
safely within two feet of us. And one
after another of the brown line ahead, we
could see this astounding meteor picking
up and passing them all.</p>

<p>Mat was right on the town bridge, steering
his grandest to cut a fine curve through
the square, when he caught that odd singing
of tempered runners. Before he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
turn his head, Tip streaked by without a
glance, doubled the corner with a beautiful
swing, and was out of sight on the next
pitch when the “Avalanche” turned into
the square.</p>

<p>Tip on a double-runner! and one with
wings, too, to judge by its speed! And Lou
Berry and Kate Morris and Amy Belle and
that pauper Okey boy with him, and that big
Brown behind—it was altogether too much!
When we got to the bottom of Depot Hill,
Tip and his party were starting back,
dragging the new craft. It was a very
heavy double-runner, with a long, springy
plank of ash, set rather low. There was
no paint on runners or deck, but everything
about the sandpapered wood had a clipper
look, and the runners were shod with steel
rods of an odd spring.</p>

<p>“Where’d ye get it, Tip?” “Ain’t it a
whaler?” “Lemme go down once with
you, Tip!” cried such of the boys as could
catch up—which was not so difficult, as old
Nell was dragging our sleds. Tip trudged
on, answering composedly:</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Brown and I got it fixed up.
’Course you can go, one at a time—we’ve
got room for just one more.”</p>

<p>But just then Mat—whose heavy sled
went farther than our light ones—overtook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
us. No doubt he felt pretty sore over being
so egregiously beaten at his own game; and
his look was anything but amiable as he
observed, loudly and in his most scornful
tone: “Huh! We feel pretty smart with a
Rebel double-runner, don’t we?”</p>

<p>Kate and Lou flushed up, and Brown
stuck out his lip contemptuously, but Tip
only answered, drily:</p>

<p>“No-o, not so awful smart—just smart
enough for what we need.”</p>

<p>This was fuel to the fire. Mat, who was
much the heavier of the two, stepped forward;
and very likely there would have
been a scene, except that the good old
minister just then stopped his sleigh for a
chat with some friends, the boys. But Mat
had clinched a nickname, and Tip’s turnout
became in every mouth “The Rebel Double-runner.”</p>

<p>Nor did it stop there. An organized
movement—in which Mat was far too
shrewd to let himself be seen, leaving it to
his younger followers—was made to cut
(boycott, as we would say nowadays) everyone
who had anything to do with Tip.</p>

<p>Brown evidently didn’t borrow much
trouble about the scorn of boys so much
younger than himself; and whatever Tip
may have felt, he said nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>But Kate and Lou felt it keenly, for even
the sisters of the camp were enlisted to
make things unpleasant for “all who gave
aid and comfort to Rebels.” But, as they
were loyal and plucky girls, they stuck
to their friend in a fashion that was
rather heroic, considering the heat and the
meanness of youthful partisanship. I trust
that for the many shabby turns done them
they found some recompense in the regularity
with which, day after day and many
times a day, they whizzed past their envious
persecutors. For Tip had left no gap in
his plans. The Rebel double-runner was
safe to win every time—thanks partly to its
superior construction, partly to the dangerous
hill on which it got its headway, and
partly to the tremendous send-off given it
by that hatefully muscular Brown.</p>

<p>Besides, Tip had a perfect genius as a
steerer—the genius of effort and fixity,
which counts oftener than any other kind.
He seemed afraid of nothing, because he
really “saw his way through.” He had
studied that slide in every inch, and knew
how to give his sled every advantage of it.</p>

<p>It was an aggravation almost beyond endurance
to have them flash by us so easily every
time; but for all Mat’s efforts and schemes
and our wild jockeying, they continued to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
it. If the continued triumph of the Rebel
double-runner was aggravating to us, it was
gall and wormwood to Mat. The thing became
a town joke; and older folks, who did not
share our grudge against Tip nor our awe
of our “Napoleon,” poked all manner of fun.</p>

<p>Suave, self-satisfied, Mat grew glum and
snappish. Those of us who ventured to
ride with Tip—and it must be confessed
that our patriotism was not always proof
against the temptation—were made to feel
the weight of Mat’s displeasure. Our
“leader of men” had not quite learned to
lead himself.</p>

<p>As we trudged up with our sleds from
the depot one afternoon, we caught sight of
Tip’s outfit whisking around the tannery
corner and bearing down like a streak of
dark lightning.</p>

<p>Mat was ahead, talking hard to young
Burpee, who had a long red-bark switch in
his hand. Just as the flying traverse was
close, the young imp flung his stick down
across the road.</p>

<p>Quick as thought we saw the act—and
that Tip saw it, too. He slid back, with
feet braced hard on the crosspiece, and
swung the sled a trifle to the right.</p>

<p>He was pale—but not half so white as
Mat, who stood glaring at him like one fascinated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
It was right on the last bridge,
over the big fall—that old wooden bridge
with its crazy railing!</p>

<p>We were too horror-struck even to cry
out, and there was no sound from the white
faces on the sled. I can remember yet how
the great falls roared, as out of a dead
hush; how Tip’s teeth showed, and that
the steering-rope was sunk deep in his
wrists. How many things made themselves
seen and felt in that instant!</p>

<p>The sled struck the slender switch
exactly square. We looked to see its occupants
fly off into space; but, though Tip
was snapped forward until his knees
bruised his face, those wiry legs saved him
and the rest, who were half piled upon him.</p>

<p>The flying ends of the switch told the
story. Tip had steered upon the slenderer
end, and the swift, high-tempered runners
had chopped it in two, as was his hope, and
without too great a shock.</p>

<p>Had the switch resisted never so little!
It seemed to us—and does to me yet—almost
a miracle of escape. But for Tip’s
instant wit, the whole party would have
broken their necks on the hill, or crashed
through the rail to the falls.</p>

<p>That day broke the back of the Cannonball
Railroad. No one would so much as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
look at Burpee; but we felt that the responsibility
rested further back.</p>

<p>Of course, Mat had not told him to throw
the switch, and doubtless made himself
believe that he had no blame in the matter.
But the rest of us—well, even boys sometimes
know how to read between the lines.</p>

<p>Tip never opened his month about the
matter, and promptly stopped any attempted
reference to it. He had plenty of
companions now, and treated them in his
square-toed boy way, as though nothing
had ever happened.</p>

<p>A week after the switch episode, the
crowd, including Tip, was straggling up
the hill as Mat and his few remaining satellites
came down on the “Avalanche.” Just
as they reached the grist-mill, a loaded
wood-sledge stalled at the tannery corner—the
snow was soft that day. The sled
was, for the same reason, not going half so
fast as usual, but quite fast enough. Seeing
the dangerous passage thus blockaded, Mat
began to get panicky, and the sled wobbled.</p>

<p>“He’s going to jump!” exclaimed someone.
“Don’t!”</p>

<p>Tip flung his sled-rope to me. “Hold to
her, Mat!” he yelled, standing at the very
edge of the slide and balanced, catlike. But
Mat did <em>not</em> hold on. The “Avalanche”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
slewed to one side, and he leaped and went
plowing and rolling fifty feet in the slush.
Almost as he struck the road, Tip had flung
himself headlong upon the steering-seat
and caught the lines.</p>

<p>He was just in time to “snub” the front
sled before it could “turn cross” and make
a wreck; and, steering through the narrow
space between the wood-sledge and the
bridge-rail, he fetched up safely with the
traverse and its four frightened boys on
the grade that climbs to Water Street.</p>

<p>That settled the business. From that
day out, I think no one was ever heard to
mention anything that sounded like “Rebel
double-runner.” It was “Tip’s Tornado,”
and there wasn’t a boy in town, except one,
but was glad to ride on it—or to follow Tip
in anything. It was the quietest of victories,
but complete.</p>

</div>

<h4>I.</h4>

<p>“But, <i lang="es">hombrote</i>, thou art a mouthful,
and the lake is brave. Of me it
counts not, but much eye to this box. That
is the far-looker that makes the pictures,
and if it went to the <i lang="es">bogas</i> or were even wet,
how couldst thou answer?”</p>

<p>“There is no care, Excellency. More
than that I am small, in this lake I was born,
and now I am made to it. I will not drown
your Excellency, nor more wet ye than
must be when the lake is so. Trust me,
<i lang="es">viracocha</i>, to put you to the island safely.
And if not then name me Bobo.”</p>

<p>Well, I had to get across, and that was all
there was to it. The island was there, I
here, the miles of angry water between, and
for bridge, only this twelve-year-old Aymará
boy with his water-logged <i lang="es">balsa</i>. I looked
out at the whitecaps, then at the unlikely
craft, then in Pablo’s eyes.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Ba-le</i>, it is well. Thou hast the heart of
a man. Hold her level for the box.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>I waded out through the mud and rushes,
waist-deep in the icy water, holding the
precious camera box on my head, and between
us we got it safely stowed abaft the
beanpole mast. Then I scrambled aboard
as best might be, with Pablo’s helpful hand
in my collar, for the mud had a trap-like
clutch on my legs. Bidding me squat forward,
the boy settled back on his knees and
began to ply his pole. The loftiest great
lake in the world has no timber on its shores,
and with the mighty forests of the Yungas
five days off no one is going to think of paddles.
Plain contorted poles of the iron <i lang="es">cupi</i>
are far more easily brought over the Andean
passes, and they have to suffice.</p>

<p>Slowly, with Pablo poling into the mud
behind, the clumsy balsa slid through the
<i lang="es">totora</i>, whispering as it went with its brother
rushes—for itself was simply a great bundle
of <i lang="es">totora</i>, <i lang="es">totora</i> bound, with <i lang="es">totora</i> sail
and sheets. There was no other thing
about it; no nail nor cord nor wood, save
only the cupi mast. The mossy tangle of
yachu, which feeds the cattle of Titi-caca
that graze all day shoulder deep in the lake,
hampered the soggy prow and fastened
upon Pablo’s stick. Sometimes, with that
and the grasping mud, I looked to see him
dragged back overboard. But he wagged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
the pole sharply and held fast with his
knees, and always shook free. Decidedly
his eyes were right—the boy was no
mouse.</p>

<p>In ten minutes we pushed our nose
through the last <i lang="es">totoral</i>, and were in the
open. The wind butted the harder in our
face; the waves—no longer tamed by the
rushen breakwater of the inshore—came
running at us like a stampede. The slow
prow kicked them and stumbled on them
and pounded them into a coarse rain that
pelted hard and icy. I wriggled out of my
coat of oiled horsehide and bound it over
the camera box to protect that from the
spray—for it had been well strained by a
fall of the pack mule in crossing the pass
of Sorata, and was no longer so waterproof
as might be wished. Pablo could now no
more touch bottom; and kneeling a little
higher and a little farther astern he kept
his pole ish-ishing through the water, paddle
fashion.</p>

<p>“Give me,” I said, after watching awhile
the play of the round boy-chest. “Thou
art too light.”</p>

<p>But Pablo sent down his stick the harder—so
forcibly, indeed, that the effort pulled
that corner of his mouth awry—and
grunted:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, <i lang="es">viracocha</i>; leave me. Your Excellency
knows the paddle—that I can see by
the way you sit. But this is different.
Only we of the lake know its ways, which
are tricky. See, <i lang="es">pues</i>!” he sputtered, as a
bucketful of water slapped us in the face
and left both gasping. “For here all the
winds quarrel from every way at once—as
if pushed by him who was once <i lang="es">alcalde</i> of
Paucarcolla.” Pablo crossed himself, thereby
“dropping a stitch” in his paddling.</p>

<p>“What? The—er—him that the Inquisition
pursued?”</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Si, viracocha</i>, that same. And yonder
headland is where he disappeared in the
lake, for the which none care to tarry there,
since it is well known that he was the devil
in person,” and Pablo crossed himself
again.</p>

<p>As we cleared the Punta del Diablo the
wind smote us with renewed force, and with
every dip a fresh deluge drenched us to the
bone. But for a few moments I did not
think much of that. With the recession of
the headland the long line of the Bolivian
Andes came marching into view, and I suppose
that just so wondrous a sight is nowhere
else. Captained by the peak that
overhangs Sorata, the giant file stood marshaled
seemingly upon the very beach of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
the vast blue lake, itself white with that
unspeakable whiteness such as befalls no
other thing on earth than a far peak of eternal
snow high up a clear sky. Such a rank
of Titans—from incalculable Illampu and
his 25,000 feet, off to where his rival, Illimani,
seemed soaring out of the lake a hundred
miles away! It was enough to make
one forget a wet skin—and even the possibility
of a wet camera box. How they
possessed the firmament, these sublimated
presences! And how the cumuli, puffing
up from the tropic forests of the Beni, tangled
about their feet and wreathed upward
and dulled when their snow-whiteness
lapped the whiter snow of those proud
crests!</p>

<p>A sharp “<em>Umpss!</em>” from Pablo recalled
me to shiver and to look back. A sudden
flaw in the wind had caught his stroke with
the full weight of the balsa, and the ironwood
pole had snapped under the cross
strain. Pablo looked anxious, but said very
evenly:</p>

<p>“<em>Pss!</em> We must break it off, <i lang="es">viracocha</i>,
and use each an end; for in this wind if we
keep not our head, even a balsa will not last.
Being angry, the lake pounds as one with
his fist.”</p>

<p>Indeed, it was more like that than anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
else—and a most reiterant fist, too.
Nowhere else is there such a “chop” as on
Lake Titi-caca when the winds awake; and
I have seen those who have weathered every
sea and who laughed at the English channel
turned deathly seasick on one of the wallowing
little steamers that run from Puno to
Chililaya. Now we were kicked about with
battering thumps that seemed like to pound
our bundle of rushes asunder. Pablo was
straining and twisting at the broken pole,
to part the wiry fibers. I chopped at it with
my heavy, keen bowie, and at last the stubborn
strands yielded; and so each had a
stick some five feet long. I knelt up and
drove mine fiercely down the side while
Pablo, astern, kept stroke. We were at it
none too soon. At one time I half fancied
that we never would get her head to the
wind, for the soggy craft answered slowly
to our efforts with these pitiful paddles.</p>

<p>For some minutes we tugged in silence.
At an altitude of 12,500 feet in Peru one
needs all one’s breath for work—even the
Serrano lad did. I glanced over my shoulder
at him now and then. His lips were
shut square, his serious dark eyes seemed
to be taking note of everything, and the
slender muscles of his arms and chest—clear
drawn on the drenched shirt—played<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
smoothly. An athlete myself, and particularly
taught in the paddle, I began to feel a
respect which was half awe for this manful
stripling who toiled so soberly and shrewdly
where only the best foreign lungs can endure
any exertion whatever. And, at last,
little as there was breath to spare, I could
not help grunting, “<i lang="es">Estás lo mas hombrote!</i>”</p>

<p>Pablo’s big white teeth shone for an instant
in a sober smile.</p>

<p>“So must we,” he answered calmly. “For
here is much to do, nor room for lazies—for
small though they be. When I was the
half of this, my father had me to help on the
balsa; and once, even then, I took it to
Puno, he being sick.”</p>

<p>Then silence fell upon us again for a time,
and we poled away doggedly. But presently
there seemed to me something wrong in
Pablo’s quiet, and I twisted my head to look.
His stick was going steadily as a machine,
but in his face was what made me call out
sharply, “What thing?”</p>

<p>He thrust out his chin toward Illampu. I
looked thither, and then back at him, uncertain.</p>

<p>“More wind,” he said, concisely. “Either
to get to the island before it, or”—and the
Spanish shrug said the rest for him.</p>

<p>We did not get to the island before it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
Two hundred yards away the gale struck
us and flattened the balsa into the waves
and the waves into the level, and was like
to strip us bodily from our soaked craft.
After that nothing was very clear, for the
winds and waves washed us fore and aft,
and it was hard to say which was the colder
and more pitiless; and one saw ill for that
bitter pelting in the face, and the heart
reeled with overwork to feed the leaping
lungs. Bent forward till our heads almost
touched the balsa, our knees wedged hard
on the tiny roll which served for gunwale,
we dug away mechanically with those
nightmares of paddles that would carry
us nowhere. Once, when my heart would
work no more, I turned idly to Pablo. His
face was gray with effort, but so sweet and
composed that I shouted out, half petulantly:</p>

<p>“Ea! Hast thou not fear, <i lang="es">hijito</i>?”</p>

<p>“How not?” he screamed back up the
wind. “Am I a fool, not to fear? We shall
never come there, perhaps. Only if the
saints will! Promise a silver candlestick,
señor!”</p>

<p>But in my eyes were a blue eyed baby and
her mother, five thousand miles away, and
for that, my temper was more to fight, with
shut teeth, than to be vowing candlesticks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
And just then it struck me to think, in that
silly maundering of the mind in stress,
how peaceful Pablo would look when they
should pick us up, and how they would add:
“<em>Umpss!</em> But these gringos are of ill temper,
no?”</p>

<p>For half an hour, perhaps, we doubled to
our sticks, and still the gale smote us, and
still our marrow ached with the chill of the
spray. There was no complaint of Pablo.
He accepted fate, but still worked like
a man—poised and steady in the face of
death. If we were to end there, he would
be found with the little chapped fists still
clenching the stick. Once a motion swept
on me to spring back and hug him and say:</p>

<p>“Son, it counts not. Let us meet it in
peace. Thou’rt fit to die with!”</p>

<p>But then again the blue eyes came up in
the mist, and my fingers cracked on the
paddle and my teeth grated. And Pablo, as
if he understood, gave me a grave, sweet
nod. Further I noted that he drew some
small object from his pouch and seemed to
breathe on it.</p>

<p>It was so near! In a little eddy of the
wind I shook the water from my eyes and
peered ahead. The northern point of the
island was not fifty yards away—and we
were drifting past. It slipped and slipped,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
for all I dug savagely at the paddle and
Pablo quickened his stroke with the first
groan I had heard from him. Our tired
arms forgot their cramps, our lungs their
“stitches” in a wild strain—and still that
dark shore kept drawing to our right. Ah,
for the old paddle that used to spin the
birch canoe! These accursed sticks—why,
one might as well paddle with a poker!</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Viracocha!</i>” The boy’s shrill voice
split the wind like a fife. “The sail!”</p>

<p>I stared at him stupidly an instant.
“Thou hast the power,” he cried. “Break
it! Break it!”</p>

<p>Then I knew, and leaped upon the ironwood
mast as a wolf at the throat of a fawn,
and clenched it and wrenched and beat, and
shoved and twisted and tugged, and with
arms and knees tore it loose from its stepping
in the balsa. It well nigh racked the
rushen raft in twain, and we noticed that
the impact of the waves no longer shook
the balsa as a unit, but wabbled and see-sawed
it.</p>

<p>I caught the cupi under my left arm and
clinched tight the “sheets” of braided
<i lang="es">totora</i> around the <i lang="es">totora</i> sail, till that was
bound in shape something like a closed umbrella,
and springing forward to my station
stood and plied this new paddle with frantic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
energy. It was unwieldy and floppy, but
it had more resistance than the pole, and
slowly—so slowly that at first we dared not
believe it—the sullen craft began to answer.
New hope came in us, and we shouted
“<i lang="es">Arre!</i> Drive!” and bent till the muscles
creaked. Now, even in Pablo’s face, was
the fierce light of combat.</p>

<p>And so we made the shore. In the lee of
the point the water was so still that it
seemed a yard lower than its surrounding
level. A lone tuft of <i lang="es">totora</i> grew near the
shore, and when we came to it I fell on my
face along the balsa and clutched the pithy
stalks; and there we lay at that frail anchorage
till heart and lungs came back in me.
Then, poling nearer, I stepped over the side
and landed the camera; and came back and
gathered in my arms a limp bundle, whose
head drooped upon my shoulder, and so
waded heavily up the beach of Sicuya.</p>

<h4>II.</h4>

<p>There was nothing on the island for a
good fire—indeed, in all that vast plateau,
so lofty and so cold, one learns the art of
shivering to perfection, for fuel is enormously
scarce. After an hour’s work I
had assembled a tiny heap of dry rushes
from the beach, and bunch grass and a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
straggling bushlets. The tinder, in its oil-cloth
pouch, with the flint and steel, was
dry, and presently we had a swift, ephemeral
blaze. It was nothing to dry us, but
served briefly to toast our hands and feet
and take off a little of that ghastly chill.
The camera was all right, and I resumed
the horsehide coat, buttoning it to my chin
to pay for the woolen shirt which I had lent
Pablo. As the darkness came on our poor
little fire died away. We scraped a trough
in the gravel and lay down in it spoon
fashion, my arms around Pablo’s chest, and
so wore out the night.</p>

<p>We were chilled and stiff and half inanimate
when the sluggard sun peeped over
the far peaks of Apolobamba, and got up
like old men. But even the light was cheering;
and presently a soft glow began to
tame the bitter air and we ran clumsily and
danced about and swung our arms till the
blood went free again in its forgotten channels.
Pablo was all right now—a boy is a
hard thing to kill, and particularly an outdoors
boy—and chatted leisurely and calmly,
as was his way.</p>

<p>“But to eat!” I broke in on one of his
stories, when we were fairly limbered up
in body and mind. “Is there <i lang="es">gente</i> on the
island?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nobody. I think the Ancients were
here once, for up yonder I have seen a
strong wall. But none come here now—not
even seeking treasure, which must be
here.”</p>

<p>“Bother the treasure! What we want
now is food, even if it were only llama
meat; for in purity of truth I’m falling
with hunger. Let us hunt.”</p>

<p>“There will be ducks, <i lang="es">pues</i>, over in the
cove. <i lang="es">Vamos!</i>”</p>

<p>Ducks there were, by the hundred; and
mudhens, and dippers, and flamingoes, and
almost every other aquatic fowl, among the
rushes in the eastern cove. With the shotgun
we could have mowed down a bushel of
them—but the shotgun was lying with my
sleeping bag and rawhide muleback trunks
over in a hut on the mainland. Well, with
the six-shooter we could count on one bird,
anyhow; and I drew it and began to rub
off last night’s rust.</p>

<p>“But wait me,” said the little balsero.
“It is better not to frighten them, for we
may need more than one. With this there
is no noise.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he unwound the braided
sling which bound his long black hair. It
was the immemorial weapon of his people—even
so I had taken it from the skulls of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
mummies of his ancestors far antedating
the Conquest. Pablo gathered some smooth
pebbles from the beach and began creeping
toward the cove, sheltering himself whenever
a bunch of <i lang="es">totora</i> offered. The water-fowl
began to edge out, and a few nervous
ducks rose. But the boy knew his business
and kept on at the same gait. Suddenly
straightening up, he whirled his right arm
thrice around, and even from where I was
I could hear a twang, and then the <em>sh-oo-oo</em>
of the hurtling pebble.</p>

<p>There was a commotion among the birds,
and a great white swan stretched and half
rose from the water and dropped back in a
shower of spray. Pablo was already in the
water, keeping out of sight all but his head,
and in a couple of rods that also disappeared.
The swan suddenly redoubled its
struggles, beating one wing till the water
foamed, but without progress. Then it
began to drift shoreward, still fighting; and
in a moment I saw a dark object rise just in
front of it. The swan saw, too, and aimed
a stunning blow with its wing. But the
head had already vanished and the screaming
bird kept moving shoreward despite
his struggles. Then I waited so long that
it seemed impossible that one should so endure
under water, when the swan’s violent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
pecking at his breast relieved me. Pablo,
to keep out of the way of that heavy wing
and beak, was holding the great bird firmly
down upon the crown of his head, and when
it was needful to take a breath he could thus
get his nose out of water without seriously
exposing himself. It was when he should
come where the water was but a couple of
feet deep that trouble would begin, and already
I judged that he was lying upon his
back and kicking along the mud. Time
after time a dark fist came up to grapple
that snake-like neck, but the bird was too
smart and the captor got only savage bites
for his pains. I ran out to help, and the
swan met me with a peck that took a morsel
off my hand; but a back sweep of the
bowie sent the head flying twenty feet, and
after a little more flopping the great fowl
fell limp. The missile from the sling had
shattered his left wing.</p>

<p>Well, when Pablo had warmed himself in
the scorching sun, and we had gathered another
bunch of dry weeds and more or less
plucked the bird and half toasted thin strips
of it in the embers, and devoured each a
wolf’s share, we felt better. Perhaps we
swallowed quite as much ashes as meat,
and salt would have helped it—but it was a
wonderful banquet, anyhow. We washed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
it down with drafts from the ill-tasting
lake, and I dried a brown-paper cigarette
on a sunny rock until it was smokable, and
for a while we wallowed in the hot sun and
watched the drift of shadows on Illampu,
which had snared all the clouds from the
sky.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Pues</i>, the pictures. And then, to get
back to shore,” I said at last, getting up reluctantly.
Pablo was greatly interested in
that wonderful glass in its shining tube,
and marveled at the unkinking of the tripod
and how the whole artful box opened and
swelled at a touch. We carried it to the top
of the hill, and I made my pictures and
showed him the inverted gem of color on
the ground glass and explained it all to him
in the formula I learned long ago for Indian
friends, to whom one has to adapt one’s own
point of view. Then he took me to the ruin—some
fallen houses and a strong wall of
great rocks wonderfully squared and carved,
and we made a picture there, with tattered
Pablo standing beside the noble handiwork
of his fathers. Unhappily, the plate fell
a victim to the abominable dampness of
Lima.</p>

<p>“If we had but a spade,” sighed Pablo,
who went scuffing his toes in the rubbish of
the forgotten rooms. “What says the <i lang="es">viracocha</i>?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
Shall we come back one day and dig
here? For surely there will be treasure.
Over yonder, toward that island, is where
they say the Incas sunk the chain of Huascar,
that the Spaniards might not find it.
And many have looked for it, and some even
talk to drain the lake.”</p>

<p>“I can see them draining Titi-caca! But
come, what was this chain of Huascar?” I
asked, as seriously as if this were all news
to me.</p>

<p>“<em>Mppss!</em> It was of gold, then—pure
gold. For when Huascar Inca was born
his father, Huayna Capac, ordered made this
chain of gold, three hundred paces long and
the fatness of my thumb, that the people
might dance holding it. Ay, if one might
find it! Sometimes, looking over the balsa,
I have thought to see <em>that</em> shining on the
bottom, but then it was only a <i lang="es">boga</i> turning
to the sun.”</p>

<p>“Ea, and what wouldst thou, <i lang="es">hijito</i>, finding
this chain of Huascar?”</p>

<p>“Yo? <i lang="es">Mpps, Vueséncia</i>, I would—<em>mppss</em>—I
would buy the balsa of Jeraldo, which
is very good; and three pigs and a cow for
my mother, and a net; and—and—and—boots
like those of your Excellency——”</p>

<p>“Good! And I hope thou’lt find it. I
mind me that an Inca, Don Garcilaso de la<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
Vega, who wrote a book two hundred and
ninety years ago—<i lang="es">sabes</i> book? Well, it is
much paper tied together—much spoiled
paper, with words on it. And this Inca said
that the chain of Huascar was thrown into
the little lake in the valley of Orcos, which
the Spaniards did indeed try to drain. But
Garcilaso said many things—particularly
in December when the days are long—and
I fancy thou’rt as like to find the chain in
this lake as in any other.”</p>

<p>“But the paper, se’or, how can it tell
these things?”</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Pues</i>, because we make paper that talks—not
out loud, but telling you things without
a sound. And sometimes it knows how
to lie, just like people.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it was not Don Garcilaso’s
fault, then—it can be that he got that kind
of paper. For I know the chain is in this
lake here, of Titi-caca, since my grandfather
told me, and he knew from very long
ago. He was taught in all the stories of our
fathers, and he gave me this <i lang="es">auqui</i> of old
for a charm. Perhaps for that we were not
swallowed by the lake.”</p>

<p>So saying, Pablo drew from his left-hand
pouch a precious little fetich of silver, ages
old, for there is no mistaking the prehistoric
handiwork of Peru. It was in rude human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
form, and not cast, but hollow, beaten out
and cupped and soldered so cleverly that
one could scarce find the joint.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Hola!</i> He was an <i lang="es">abuelo</i> worth having.
Come, I’ll give thee ten <i lang="es">soles</i> for it, for I
shall need an <i lang="es">auqui</i> myself if I am to stay in
these lands of ill luck.”</p>

<p>But Pablo shook his head, though I am
positive he never had seen so much money
in one pile before as the ten silver dollars in
my hand.</p>

<p>“<i>Ha-ni-wa!</i>” he said. “For it is ill to
sell these things, which are sacred.” He
breathed on the image and tucked it carefully
back in his <i lang="es">chuspa</i>.</p>

<p>The balsa, still nodding at the rushen
cable, was soon repaired by Pablo’s apt
hands with a few withes of <i lang="es">totora</i>. We
stepped the mast again, as well as might be,
in its torn socket, hoisted the rush sail, and
drew slowly out in a light breeze. It was a
very different passage from that of yesterday,
and we sprawled lazily along the balsa,
looking back now to the vast white peaks,
and now to the weedy shore ahead. We
crept through the outer fringe of <i lang="es">totora</i>,
passing far to the left of a little stone hut
that seemed built upon the very water a
mile from shore. A few sad cattle lay about
it, only their heads out of water; and nearer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
us, on a submerged bar, a gristly pig seemed
undecided whether he had better root or
swim. It was Pablo’s home, he told me—a
fair type of the pitiful swamp ranches of
the lake dwellers. In the shoals they build
their squalid huts and raise the unkempt
cattle which know no other pasturage—as
their owners no other world.</p>

<p>When we came to the head of the bay and
had waded ashore with the camera, we
stood a long time in the mud looking back
at the blue lake and the dark island. I was
sore and hungry, and with much to do; but,
somehow, it was hard to turn away. Pablo
stood screwing his bare toes into the ooze, in
as little haste to be off.</p>

<p>“And will your Excellency come again?”
he said at last, catching my eye and then
turning away.</p>

<p>“Who knows, <i lang="es">hijito</i>? To-morrow I take
mule for the Desaguadero. Perhaps some
day. But much eye that thou have a new
balsa ready against then, for this is too old.
And here is wherewith to buy Jeraldo’s,
without waiting to find the chain of Huascar.
<i lang="es">Adios</i>, then, and—<i lang="es">un abrazo!</i>”</p>

<p>He reached up to my shoulders and laid
his head against me with a little tug, and
suddenly broke away and started for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
balsa. Midway he stopped and turned and
came splashing back.</p>

<p>“Hear, <i lang="es">viracocha</i>,” he said, with a little
uncertainty in his voice. “I could not sell
the <i lang="es">auqui</i>, for it is not honest to take money
for sacred things. But one who goes so far
as your Excellency, and in many dangers,
ought indeed to have one to keep harm
from him. And for that you—that—that
we were brothered in danger and you did
not despise me, now I give you.” And
flinging the precious figure at my feet, before
I could gather my wits he was spattering
out to the balsa. Nor would he return.
Ten minutes later, when I looked back from
the hut where my things were stored, the
drab patch of his sail had quite faded in the
<i lang="es">totoral</i>.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
